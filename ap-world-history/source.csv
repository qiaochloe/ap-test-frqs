An ambassador from another [Chinese] state desired a jade ring that belonged to a merchant who resided in the Chinese state of Lu. So the ambassador begged Zi Chan, a Lu official, to have the ring confiscated from the merchant and given to him. Zi Chan, however, refused, saying, “One of our ancient rulers made a pact with the merchants in our state, to last through all generations. The pact said, ‘If you do not revolt against me [the ruler], I will not violently interfere with your commerce. I will not beg or take anything from you, and you may have your profitable markets, precious things, and substance, without my taking any knowledge of them.’ Through this attested covenant, our rulers and the merchants who live in our territory have preserved their mutual relations down to the present day. If you get the jade and lose a friendly state, wouldn’t that be a mistake?” 
The ambassador then changed his mind, saying, “I presumed in my stupidity to ask for the jade, which would have occasioned such a calamity. Let me now withdraw my request.”

He shall also determine the time suitable for the distribution, purchase, and sale of various kinds of merchandise. He shall avoid setting prices that allow for such large profits for merchants as to harm the people. 
All those who sell merchandise shall submit to the Superintendent their sale reports, saying “this much has been sold and this much remains”; they shall also hand over their weights and measures for inspection. 
The Superintendent of Commerce shall fix prices to allow a profit of five percent for local commodities and ten percent on foreign produce. Merchants who inflate the price even half a penny more than that shall be punished with a fine.

We generally accept as true the following statements about trade and occupations, in regard to which are suitable for gentlemen and which are vulgar. First, those occupations are condemned, which bring upon you peoples’ hatred, such as tax collecting and moneylending. Also vulgar and unsuitable for gentlemen are the occupations of all hired workmen whom we pay for their labor, not for their artistic skills. Also to be considered vulgar are retail merchants, who buy from wholesale merchants and immediately turn around and resell; for they would not make a profit unless they lied a lot. Of all the occupations from which profit is accrued, none is better than agriculture, none more profitable, none more delightful, none more suitable to a free man.... 
When Cato [a Roman statesman well-known for his moral integrity] was asked what was the best form of property ownership he replied. “Raising livestock with great success.” And after that? “Raising livestock with little success.” And third? “Raising crops.” And when the person asking the questions said, “What about moneylending?” Cato replied, “What about murder?”

The blessed Melania [383–438 C.E.] and her husband Pinian both came from foremost [Roman] families of senatorial rank. But they resolved to abandon their frivolous and worldly mode of life and experience an angelic, heavenly purpose. They left the great city of Rome and went to their suburban estate, where they devoted themselves to the practice of the virtues. They knew that it was impossible for them to offer pure worship to God unless they made themselves enemies to the confusions of a wealthy life.... [Melania described their estate in the following manner:] “It was an extraordinary piece of property and in it stood a bath that surpassed any other in worldly splendor. The estate had a total of sixty-two settlements within its borders, with four hundred slaves. But I knew that it was the Devil who set before me those multicolored marbles, the villa, and all that inestimable revenue.” So the blessed ones fearlessly gave away all their possessions, which were enough for the entire world. They established monasteries of monks and nuns, furnishing each place with a sufficient amount of gold. They presented their numerous expensive silk clothes at the altars of churches and made many other offerings to God.

O you who believe! Spend on others out of the good things you may have acquired, and out of that which God brings forth for you from the earth; and choose not for your charity things that you yourselves would not want or accept without averting your eyes in disdain. Satan threatens you with the prospect of poverty and bids you to be stingy, but God is infinite, all-knowing, granting wisdom unto whom He wills. Whatever you may spend on others, or vow to spend, God knows it; and those who do wrong by withholding charity shall have no one to comfort them. If you do deeds of charity openly, it is well, but if you bestow it upon the needy in secret, it will be even better for you, and it will atone for some of your bad deeds.

Ever since the British introduced the noble game of cricket among the natives of Bombay nearly twenty years ago, more than five hundred young men of all ages and of all castes pursue this healthful sport on the Parade ground where alone they are permitted to play and which is the only ground suitable for cricket.  
Therefore, we cannot understand that the comforts and convenience of the half-a-dozen English gentlemen, who generally play polo, should be preferred to the necessary healthful recreation of over five hundred native youths. The polo ponies completely ruin the turf and render the ground unsuited to cricket. 
Under the circumstances, will your Excellency and council please request that the English play polo on another spot or allow your Petitioners to play along with the English on the ground at present reserved for the exclusive use of the English cricketers and which is much too large for their requirements?

At the end of the season he will again visit India at the head of a team of English players—not too strong, but just strong enough; then in 1900 he will come back to  Old England as captain of a team representative of Indian cricket.

First the hunter, the missionary, and the merchant, next the soldier and the politician, and then the cricketer—that is the history of British colonization. And of these civilizing influences, the last may, perhaps, be said to do least harm. Cricket unites the rulers and the ruled. It also provides a moral training, an education in pluck, and nerve, and self-restraint, far more valuable to the character of the ordinary native than the mere learning by heart of a play by Shakespeare.

Cricket, in my opinion, it’s not an elite sport like polo, it’s not one of several sports as you have in England. Here there’s one sport in India and Pakistan. That’s the reason why cricket has a place in bringing people together. We expect 20,000 Indian fans.

From morning, while it was still dark, we worked in the lamplit factory till ten at night. After work, we hardly had the strength to stand on our feet. When we worked later into  the night, they occasionally gave us a yam. We then had to do our washing, fix our hair, and so on. By then it would be eleven o’clock. There was no heat even in the winter; we had to sleep huddled together to stay warm. We were not paid the first year. In the second year my parents got 35 yen,* and the following year 50 yen. 
Soon after I went to work in the factory, my younger sister Aki came to work there too.  I think she worked for about two years, and then took to her bed because of illness. At  that time there were about thirty sick people at the factory. Those who clearly had lung troubles were sent home right away. Everyone feared tuberculosis and no one would come near such patients. Aki was also sent home, and died soon after. She was in her thirteenth year. Aki had come to the factory determined to become a 100-yen worker and make our mother happy. I can never forget her sad eyes as she left the factory sickly and pale.

Where do the cheap workers come from? They all come from farming communities. People from families that are working their own land, or are engaged in tenant farming  but have surplus workers, come to the cities and the industrial centers to become factory workers. Income from the farms provides for the family needs and subsistence of the parents and siblings. The person who takes employment in the factory is an unattached component of the family. All he or she has to do is earn enough to maintain his or her  own living. That is why the workers’ wages are low. This shows how important a force agriculture continues to be for the development of our nation’s commerce and industry.

In earlier times workers were allowed to do both foundry work and salt-boiling as long as they reported the work and paid a tax. Tools manufactured by individual families to do this work were well-made. Today the iron tools that workers are required to use are produced by the state using convict labor; these tools are often crude and not very functional. In previous times the tools manufactured by workers for their own use and for sale were of excellent quality. Now that the state has monopolized the salt and iron trades, most of the tools provided to the workers are hard and brittle and the responsible government officials are often not available to take complaints. Good implements are hard to come by. Salt and iron are now sold at very high prices by the state and many common people cannot afford to buy either. Some of the poorest peasants now have no choice but to till the soil with wooden plows and cannot afford salt to season their food.

For the roads were carried straight through the country without wavering, and were paved with quarried stone, and made solid with masses of tightly packed sand. Hollows were filled up and bridges were built across whatever wintry streams or ravines cut the roads. And both sides were an equal and parallel height with the result that the road for its entire course had a level and beautiful appearance. Besides these things, he measured the whole road mile by mile and set up stone columns as distance indicators.

Indiscriminate abuse is lavished freely without regard to differences in rank and social scale. Passengers have often been struck and otherwise treated with great indignity. Passengers traveling in second class are not even allowed to get to the platform, but are made to herd with the masses outside. We would like to emphasize the painful fact that the most respectable natives are liable to personal ill-treatment and loss from their European fellow passengers in the second-class carriages. Native gentlemen of birth and respectability, in striving to avoid the large crowds to be found in third-class carriages, find themselves even worse off in a second-class seat. In a variety of ways attempts are incessantly made to degrade and insult second-class passengers. 
We want to draw attention here to the present impossibility of native ladies of respectable birth and breeding taking advantage of railways. The honor of our wives and families is very dear and sacred to us, and the advent of the railway has cut off old modes of transit without providing adequate ones for respectable women.

What shall we do about telegraphs and railroads? The Qin dynasty built the Great Wall, and at the time it was considered a disaster, but later generations relied on it. If telegraphs and railroads are built, China will likewise enjoy great benefits from them in the future. Moreover, as the work of constructing them is enormous, it will be quite beneficial to the poor people now. However, although the foreigners plead with the Court to conclude a formal treaty permitting them to begin this work, this absolutely must not be done. Perhaps the government could give its generous permission, but only if the Western [interests] can devise a plan that would guarantee that no arable fields, houses, and ancestral graves would be harmed in the least. Otherwise, permission should decidedly not be given.

Unless an alternative way, other than the Suez Canal controlled by the British, is found to connect the holy cities [of Mecca and Medina] to the rest of the empire, the Red Sea coast of Arabia might fall prey to the evils

 At present, Muslims going on 
pilgrimage must either use foreign ships, where they are subjected to humiliation, or travel by camel, a very challenging journey through months of drought. It has become necessary to construct a railway in this region, both to solve these problems and to show the power of the caliph. The railway has to be built solely by Muslim involvement, by obtaining a huge amount of finance from the Islamic world and recruiting Muslim engineers in its construction. 
Our sultan must personally lead this highly significant undertaking. Muslims across the world hold our sultan in very high regard; therefore people of political and economic influence will not hesitate to allocate some of their assets to this cause when they see our sultan personally leading the initiative.

The figure presents an illustration of a partial map of Africa. The following major areas are labeled, from north to south: Egypt, Abyssinia, British East Africa, Congo State, German East Africa, and Transvaal. The following areas are labeled British Territories: Egypt, present-day Sudan, British East Africa, and portions of southern Africa, including Rhodesia (present-day Zimbabwe), and territories in present-day South Africa, Botswana, and Zambia. The following three stages of railroad construction are drawn on the map: Railroad completed, Railroad under construction, and Railroad proposed. The routes for each of the stages are indicated as follows, from north to south. 

Railroad completed: From Cairo to Aswan, in southern Egypt; from Wadi Halfa to Dongola, in northern Sudan, and from Wadi Halfa to an unlabeled point in Sudan northeast of Khartoum; from Mombasa on the Indian Ocean in British East Africa, in present-day Kenya, to an unlabeled point in the interior of British East Africa; from Beira on the Indian Ocean, in present-day Mozambique, to an unlabeled point northeast of Bulawayo in Rhodesia, in present-day Zimbabwe; from Bulawayo to Cape Town near the southern tip of Africa; from Johannesburg in the Transvaal, which is present-day South Africa, to an unlabeled point on the Indian Ocean near present-day Maputo, Mozambique; from Johannesburg to Durban on the Indian Ocean

Railroad under construction: From the unlabeled southern end point of the railway built from Wadi Halfa south to Khartoum; from Bulawayo north to an unlabeled point about halfway between Bulawayo and Lake Tanganyika.

Railroad proposed: From Aswan to Wadi Halfa; from an unlabeled point on the Red Sea coast of Sudan to the unlabeled southern end point of the railway built from Wadi Halfa in the direction of Khartoum south; from Khartoum south to the shore of Lake Victoria; from the shore of Lake Victoria to Ujiji on Lake Tanganyika, in present-day Tanzania; from Ujiji east through German East Africa to Dar es Salaam on the coast of the Indian Ocean, in present-day Tanzania, with a branch connecting to the southern shore of Lake Victoria; from the unlabeled northern point of the railway built from Mombasa to an unlabeled point on the eastern shore of Lake Victoria; from Ujiji to Abercorn, which is present-day Mbala, Zambia; from Abercorn to the unlabeled northern end-point of the railroad under construction north from Bulawayo; from Bulawayo northeast to the unlabeled end point of the railroad built inland from Beira.

When considered together, the routes on the map form a line from Cairo to Cape Town, running mostly through British territory, with several side branches connecting mostly to ports on the Indian Ocean

Since the Great Wall of China the world has never seen an undertaking of equal magnitude. Russia, single-handedly, has conceived it and carried it out. Its strategic results are already easy to foresee. It will consolidate Russian influence in the Far East in a manner yet undreamed of. But this will be by slow steps. The expectation that the railroad could be used to transport masses of soldiers from European Russia to China, either in response to an attack or for Russia herself to launch an attack, is yet far from becoming reality. The line and its organization would break down utterly under such pressure. But bit by bit it will grow in capacity, and the Powers that have enormous interests at stake in the Far East, if they continue to sleep as England has done of late, will wake to find a new, solid, impenetrable, self-sufficient Russia dominating China as she has dominated, sooner or later, every other Oriental land against whose frontier she has laid her own.

True economic activity cannot even be conceived without railroads. It is, therefore, our duty as a civilized nation to take those steps that nature itself imposes and that are the only effective ones.

The arming of the people for resistance against Japan had placed the peasants in a position to challenge the landlords and money lenders in the countryside, and not even the tremendous prestige of the Chinese Communist Party or the critical situation of the country and the world could prevent this challenge from breaking out in one form or another. This increasingly explosive force transferred land from the landowners to the peasants. Now peasants demanded not only the correction of abuses but also repayment of overcharges and restoration of lands and property seized in default of debts. When grievances were totaled up, the charges almost always amounted to more than most landowning families could pay, and everything they owned was transferred from the landlords to the peasants for distribution.

He chose not to follow the life of a husbandman, but rather to study, learn and exercise the rudiment of more subtle conceptions. For this reason, aspiring to the merchant’s trade, he began to follow the chapman’s [peddler’s] way of life, first learning how to gain in small bargains and things of insignificant price; and to gain from things of greater expense. 
Thus aspiring ever higher and higher, and yearning upward with his whole heart, at length his great labors and cares bore much fruit of worldly gain. For he labored not only as a merchant but also as a shipman to Denmark and Flanders and Scotland; in all which lands he found certain rare, and therefore more precious, wares, which he carried to other parts wherein he knew them to be least familiar, and coveted by the inhabitants beyond the price of gold itself; wherefore he exchanged these wares for others coveted by men of other lands; and thus chaffered [bargained] most freely and assiduously. Hence he made great profit in all his bargains, and gathered much wealth in the sweat of his brow; for he sold dear in one place the wares which he had bought elsewhere at a small price.  [But later] he began to yearn for solitude, and to hold his merchandise in less esteem than heretofore. 
And now he had lived sixteen years as a merchant, and began to think of spending on charity, to God’s honor and service, the goods which he had so laboriously acquired. He therefore took the cross as a pilgrim to Jerusalem. 
Godric was now already firmly disposed to give himself entirely to God’s service. Wherefore, that he might follow Christ the more freely, he sold all his possessions and distributed them among the poor. For above all things he coveted the life of a hermit.

It is written (Matthew vii. 12): All things . . . whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do you also to them. But no man wishes to buy a thing for more than its worth. Therefore no man should sell a thing to another man for more than its worth. 
I answer that it is altogether sinful to have recourse to deceit in order to sell a thing for more than its just price, because this is to deceive one’s neighbor so as to injure him. Hence Tully [Cicero, the Roman writer] says:  Contracts should be entirely free from double-dealing:  the seller must not impose upon the bidder, nor the buyer upon one that bids against him. 
Therefore if either the price exceed the quantity of the thing’s worth, or, conversely, the thing exceed the price, there is no longer the equality of justice:  and consequently, to sell a thing for more than its worth, or to buy it for less than its worth, is in itself unjust and unlawful. 
Now no man should sell what is not his, though he may charge for the loss he suffers.

Commerce is the increasing of capital by buying goods and attempting to sell them at a price higher than their cost. This is done either by waiting for a rise in the market price; or by transporting the goods to another place where they are more keenly demanded and therefore fetch a higher price; or, lastly, by selling them on a long-term credit basis. Commercial profit is small, relatively to the capital invested, but if the capital is large, even a low rate of profit will produce a large total gain. 
In order to achieve this increase in capital, it is necessary to have enough initial capital to pay in cash the sellers from whom one buys goods; it is also necessary to sell for cash, as honesty is not widespread among people. This dishonesty leads on the one hand to fraud and the adulteration of goods, and on the other to delays on payment which diminish profits because capital remains idle during the interval. It also induces buyers to repudiate their debts, a practice which is very injurious to the merchant’s capital. 
The manners of tradesmen are inferior to those of rulers, and far removed from manliness and uprightness. We have already stated that traders must buy and sell and seek profits. This necessitates flattery, and evasiveness, litigation and disputation, all of which are characteristic of this profession. And these qualities lead to a decrease and weakening in virtue and manliness. For these acts inevitably affect the soul. 
As for Trade, although it be a natural means of livelihood, yet most of the methods it employs are tricks aimed at making a profit by securing the difference between the buying and selling prices, and by appropriating the surplus. This is why [religious] Law allows the use of such methods, which, although they come under the heading of gambling, yet do not constitute the taking without return of other people’s goods.

Our mutual enemy, King Frederick of Prussia, is at full strength because the Russians have withdrawn their forces. Now he will certainly attack somewhere with concentrated force. Austria has always hoped to change the theater of the war and to move troops to  the territories Frederick seized from us. We had hoped to hold Frederick so firmly there that he could not turn back to your Saxony, but the deceptions and incompetence of the Russians upset all our plans. 
Peace seems further away than ever. I fear that sometime during the coming winter the Prussians will move against our allies the French, and we will not be able to prevent this.

If the aid of the Ottoman Turks is not forthcoming, our courage and our armed forces will be unequal to winning our next campaign, let alone recapturing our territory. Quite simply, we are lost without the Turks’ help. It seems to me that we ought to open peace negotiations with our enemies, so as to rescue all we can from the wreckage of my cause. I therefore leave it to your judgment to decide whether to embark on these negotiations through the British, or whether the situation is so urgent that you must address yourself directly to France, Austria, or Russia.

The friars even instigated them to take up arms against us. The Augustinians also schemed to prevent all kinds of food from reaching Manila.

If the Muslims do not take to the system of education introduced by the British, they will not only remain a backward community, but will sink lower and lower until there will be no hope of recovery left to them. 
If the choice were to lie between giving up and preserving Islam, I would have unhesitatingly chosen Islam. That, however, is not the choice. The adoption of the new system of education does not mean the renunciation of Islam. It means its protection. We are justly proud of the achievements of our forefathers in the fields of learning and culture, but these achievements were possible only because they were willing to act upon the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. The Prophet said that knowledge is the heritage of the believer and that he should acquire it wherever he can find it. He also said that the Muslims should seek knowledge even if they have to go to China, which at that time was one of the most civilized countries in the world, but it was a non-Muslim country and could not teach the Muslims anything about their own religion. Did the early Muslims not take to Greek learning avidly? Did this in any respect undermine their loyalty to Islam? 
Europe has made such remarkable progress in science that it would be suicidal not to make an effort to acquire that knowledge. How can we remain true Muslims or serve Islam if we sink into ignorance?

Among our forefathers were those who maintained that the land of Islam is the fatherland of all Muslims. However, that is a colonialist formula used to advantage by every colonizing nation that seeks to expand its possessions and to extend its influence daily over neighboring countries. Today the [traditional Islamic] formula has no reason to exist. We must replace this formula with the only doctrine that is in accord with every Eastern nation that possesses a clearly defined sense of fatherland. That doctrine is nationalism. 
Our love of Egypt must be free from all conflicting associations. We must suppress our propensity for anything other than Egypt because patriotism, which is love of fatherland, does not permit such ties. 
Our Egyptian-ness demands that our fatherland be our qibla* and that we not turn our face to any other.

We want to be like the European nations in military power in order to repel the attack of any aggressor and to be able to say to our English friends, “Thank you, you may go, for we can now defend the Suez Canal.” Who wants the end must want the means; who wants power must want the elements constituting it; who wants a strong European-type army must want European training.

For nearly fourteen centuries the Islamic factor has represented the crucial dilemma and the core of our identity. We are the product of the challenges it has undergone or made others undergo. The relationship with the Christian world, which has often been a relationship of confrontation, has helped shape our history and draw the contours of our world of today. But this relationship is not linear, is not made merely of confrontations. There were also great moments of synthesis, of opening toward the other, of spaces opened for greater comprehension. They coincide, in short, with the great moments of our history. Universal inheritances—like the teachings of Aristotle, of Plato, or of Socrates, for example—were saved from oblivion by the Muslims. It is there that the humanist quest would take on its myriad colors, where the German poet Schiller’s “Ode to Joy” has had its deepest echoes.

Every succeeding year, the demand for labor will increase in an almost geometrical ratio.

The Green Revolution has won a temporary success in man’s war against hunger and deprivation; it has given man a breathing space.

How the Green Revolution affects rural people depends on whether they are wage earners, cultivators or consumers, whether they come from landed or landless, rich or poor, male-or female-headed households. 
Studies on the impact of the Green Revolution have shown that technological change can generate major social benefits but at the same time generate significant costs for particular categories of rural women that are different in kind and in intensity from those experienced by men. 
It has: 
 increased the need for cash incomes in rural households to cover the costs of seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, forcing women to work as agricultural laborers; 
 increased the need for unpaid female labor for farming tasks thereby augmenting women’s already high labor burden; 
 limited women’s wage-earning opportunities through mechanization.

The Green Revolution has been a failure. It has led to reduced genetic diversity, increased vulnerability to pests, soil erosion, water shortages, reduced soil fertility, micronutrient deficiencies, soil contamination, reduced availability of nutritious food crops for the local population, the displacement of vast numbers of small farmers from their land, rural impoverishment, and increased tensions and conflicts. The beneficiaries have been the agrochemical industry, large petrochemical companies, manufacturers of agricultural machinery, dam builders, and large landowners. 
The Punjab is frequently cited as the Green Revolution’s most celebrated success story. Yet, far from bringing prosperity, two decades of the Green Revolution have left the Punjab riddled with discontent and violence. Instead of abundance, the Punjab is beset with diseased soils, pest-infested crops, waterlogged deserts, and indebted and discontented farmers. Instead of peace, the Punjab has inherited conflict and violence. 
Traditionally, irrigation was only used in the Punjab as an insurance against crop failure in times of severe drought. The new seeds, however, need intensive irrigation as an essential input for crop yields. One result of the Green Revolution has therefore been to create conflicts over diminishing water resources. Intensive irrigation has led to the need for large-scale storage systems, centralizing control over water supplies and leading to both local and interstate water conflicts.

The Second Noble Truth is the Noble Truth of the Arising of Sorrow; it arises from craving, which leads to rebirth, which brings delight and passion, and seeks pleasure—the craving for sensual pleasure, the craving for continued life, and the craving for power. 
The Third Noble Truth is the Noble Truth of the Stopping of Sorrow. It is the complete stopping of that craving, so that no passion remains, leaving it, being emancipated from  it, being released from it, giving no place to it.

Question:  If Buddhism is the greatest and most venerable of ways, why did the great sages of the past and Confucius not practice it? In the Confucian Classics no one mentions it. Why, then, do you love the Way of the Buddha and rejoice in outlandish arts? Can the writings of the Buddha exceed the Classics and commentaries and beautify the accomplishments of the sages? 
Answer:  All written works need not necessarily be the words of Confucius. To compare  the sages to the Buddha would be like comparing a white deer to a unicorn, or a swallow to  a phoenix. The records and teachings of the Confucian classics do not contain everything. Even if the Buddha is not mentioned in them, what occasion is there for suspicion? 
Question:  Now of happiness there is none greater than the continuation of one’s line, of unfilial conduct there is none worse than childlessness. The monks forsake wives and children, reject property and wealth. Some do not marry all their lives.  
Answer:  Wives, children, and property are the luxuries of the world, but simple living and inaction are the wonders of the Way. The monk practices the Way and substitutes that for worldly pleasures. He accumulates goodness and wisdom in exchange for the joys of having a wife and children.

If these practices are not stopped, and this relic of the Buddha is allowed to be carried from one temple to another, there will be those in the crowd who will cut off their arms and mutilate their flesh in offering to the Buddha. 
Now the Buddha was a man of the barbarians who did not speak Chinese and who wore clothes of a different fashion. The Buddha’s sayings contain nothing about our ancient kings and the Buddha’s manner of dress did not conform to our laws; he understood neither the duties that bind sovereign and subject, nor the affections of father and son. If the Buddha were still alive today and came to our court, Your Majesty might condescend to receive him, but he would then be escorted to the borders of the nation, dismissed, and not allowed to delude the masses.

So in this latter age Buddhism has transmitted its strange ways and has spread like a luxuriant vine until it has poisoned the customs of our nation. Buddhism has spread to all the nine provinces of China; each day finds its monks and followers growing more numerous and its temples more lofty. Buddhism wears out the people’s strength, pilfers their wealth, causes people to abandon their lords and parents for the company of teachers, and severs man and wife with its monastic decrees. In destroying law and injuring humankind indeed nothing surpasses this doctrine! 
Now if even one man fails to work the fields, someone must go hungry; if one woman does  not tend her silkworms, someone will go cold. At present there are an inestimable number  of monks and nuns in the empire, all of them waiting for the farmers to feed them and the silkworms to clothe them while the Buddhist public temples and private chapels have reached boundless numbers, sufficient to outshine the imperial palace itself.

The suggestion that Ashanti in its present state should come and enjoy the protection  of Her Majesty the Queen of England and Empress of India is a matter of very serious consideration. I am pleased to announce that we have arrived at the conclusion that my kingdom of Ashanti will never commit itself to any such policy. Ashanti must remain  as of old and at the same time remain friendly with all White men.

I have no intention at all of being an indifferent spectator, if the distant Powers hold onto the idea of dividing up Africa. For the past fourteen centuries Ethiopia has been an island of Christians in a sea of Pagans. 
Since the All-Powerful has protected Ethiopia up until now, I am hopeful that He will  keep and enlarge it also in the future, and I do not think for a moment that He will divide Ethiopia among the distant Powers. In the past, the boundary of Ethiopia was the sea. Without our use of force and without the aid of the Christians, our boundary on the sea fell into the hands of the Muslims. Today we do not pretend to be able to recover our seacoast by force; but we hope that the Christian Powers, advised by our Savior, Jesus Christ, will restore our seacoast boundary to us, or give us at least a few ports along the coast.

So we surrendered to the White people and were told to go back to our homes and live our usual lives and attend to our crops. We were treated like slaves. They came and were overbearing. We were ordered to carry their clothes and bundles. They harmed our wives and our daughters. How the rebellion started I do not know; there was no organization, it was like a fire that suddenly flames up. I had an old gun. They—the White men—fought us with big guns, machine guns, and rifles. Many of our people were killed in this fight:   I saw four of my cousins shot. We made many charges but each time we were defeated. But for the White men’s machine guns, it would have been different.

The medicine guaranteed a good harvest, so that in future people would no more need to perform wage labor for foreigners in order to obtain accustomed luxuries. The medicine would also give invulnerability, acting in such a way that enemy bullets would fall from their targets like raindrops from a greased body. It would strengthen women and children for the flight customary in wartime, with the associated hardships and privations, and protect them from being seized by the victorious attackers, who were accustomed to taking women and children with them as war prizes. The medicine consisted of water, maize, and sorghum grains. The water was applied by pouring it over the head and by drinking.

The government is not indifferent to the evils afflicting the working class of the Republic: if their wages are inadequate or if they lack employment, the first one to regret this situation is the president. However, these are private ills that fall largely beyond the government’s power to correct. Such is the case, unfortunately, of the problems that afflict the working class that you so honorably represent. 
Given the laws that govern our country, the government cannot restrict the freedom of factory owners to fire or hire workers, nor can it intervene directly in the improvement of basic working conditions. No laws permit this nor do any economic interests oblige the government to dictate salaries, or prices, or working hours. 
In your demands, you invoke the right to work. But this right also implies the obligation to find jobs. It cannot be the government’s responsibility to supply workers with jobs, or to compel anyone else to supply them. Labor is subject, by unavoidable natural phenomena, to the law of supply and demand.

Gentlemen, if we compare the Mexico of today with the Mexico of thirty years ago, the justice and the administrative abilities of our President Porfirio Díaz become apparent (applause). In the Mexico of today peace and tranquility reign supreme through the land, public education has made great progress, sanitary regulations are strictly adhered to, railways have been built, and public safety and the rights of foreigners (as well as of Mexicans) are rigidly safeguarded. The [United States] Department of Commerce and Labor recently praised the leaders of the Mexican Republic who, “realizing the necessity for outside aid in developing the natural resources of their country, have wisely framed such laws as are required to guarantee the commercial, financial, and industrial interests of [American] businesses and have thereby achieved the constant increase of foreign capital invested in Mexico.” 
All that I have said is sufficient to demonstrate the flourishing condition of Mexico and that we Mexicans, by placing General Díaz at the head of the administration of our country have, as you say, “the right man, in the right place, at the right time.” (applause)

Slavery in Mexico! Yes, I found it. I found it first in Yucatan. The climate of northern Yucatan happens to be perfectly adapted to the production of henequen.* Here we find vast henequen plantations extending for miles and miles. The owners of these great plantations are the chief slave-holders of Yucatan and the plantation workers are the slaves. The slaves are 8,000 Yaqui Indians imported from Northern Mexico, 3,000 Chinese and Koreans, and between 100,000 and 125,000 native Mayas, who formerly owned the lands that the henequen planters now own. 
The planters do not call their workers “slaves” especially when speaking to strangers. They do not call their system slavery; they call it enforced service for debt. At first I thought it would not be so bad if the servant had an opportunity of buying back his freedom. But I found that such was not the custom. “You need have no fear in purchasing this plantation,” one owner said to me, “of the laborers being able to buy their freedom and leave you. They can never do that.” “It is very easy to recruit workers,” another planter told me. “All that is necessary is that you get some free laborer in debt to you, and then you have him. We are always getting new laborers in that way.”

Source: Ricardo Flores Mag, Mexican intellectual and social reform activist of Native American ethnicity, “The Right of Property,” editorial published in the revolutionary newspaper Regeneraci (Rebirth), March, 1911. 
The right of property is an absurd right because it had its origins in crime, fraud, and abuse of power. In the past, land was worked in common, forests provided firewood to the hearths of all, harvests were distributed among the members of the community according to their needs. In Mexico, this custom thrived in indigenous communities in the era of Spanish domination and existed until recently. The attempt to take away the common lands of indigenous communities caused the recent Yaqui Wars in Sonora and the troubles with the Mayas in the Yucatan. 
The return of the land to the peasants should be accomplished during the present uprising. We revolutionaries will not be committing a crime by turning over the land to the working people, because, by natural law, it already belongs to them. It is the land that their ancestors watered with their sweat; the land that the Spaniards robbed by force from our Indian fathers. That land belongs to all Mexicans. Some of those who own the land currently might have bought it; others might have acquired the land by taking advantage of their friendship with corrupt government officials. Others still acquired the land by giving loans with high interest to the small indigenous farmers, forcing them to leave the land because they could not repay the debt.

"“While the world revolution of Westernization [after 1850] created a political world order radically different from all past human experience, it also disrupted the non-Western societies constituting the bulk of humanity. . . . The Westerners with their sense of mission also introduced their education. Along the way [Western-educated intellectuals from non-Western societies] soon acquired a taste for the dominant ideals of the West, especially the liberal plea for equality, freedom, and self-determination and the socialists’ cry for social justice for all exploited and oppressed peoples and classes.... 
Inevitably, the non-Western intellectuals turned their lessons to their own use. The ideals of freedom and self-determination justified protests over the humiliation of their countries and cultures. As a result of their Westernization they became anti-Western nationalists, caught in a love-hate attitude toward the West....

On the first step, at the lowest level, is a nun in a habit with an arm outstretched. On the second step is a nurse in uniform, sitting on a chair and holding a sleeping baby in blankets. On the third step is a school teacher in a dress instructing a young girl who stands next to her, reading a book. On the fourth step, at the highest level in the center of the figure is an elegantly dressed clothier, holding a scarf in one hand while her other hand is resting on a pillar at her side. On the fifth step is a servant dressed in a maid’s uniform, holding a broom and dustpan. On the sixth step is a worker, dressed in simple clothes, constructing a piece of furniture. On the seventh step, at the lowest level, is a peasant woman dressed in simple clothes, holding a scythe in one hand and a spade in the other.

Camp Devens has about 50,000 men, or it did before the epidemic broke loose. The epidemic started about four weeks ago, and has developed so rapidly that the camp is demoralized and all ordinary work is held up till it has passed. All assemblages of soldiers are taboo. We have been averaging about 100 deaths a day, and still keeping  it up.  
The normal number of doctors here is about 25 and that has been increased to over 250, all of whom have temporary orders. The little town nearby is quite a sight. It takes special trains to carry away the dead. For several days there were no coffins and the bodies piled up something fierce. We used to go down to the morgue and look at the boys laid out in rows. It beats any sight they ever had in France after a battle.

Katherine and I just returned last Sunday evening from Camp Humphreys “Somewhere in Virginia” where we helped nurse soldiers sick with the Influenza. We were there at the camp for ten days among some of the very worst cases and yet we did not contract it. We had intended staying much longer than we did, but the work was entirely too hard for us. We worked from seven in the morning until seven at night with only a short time for luncheon and dinner. Our chief duties were to give medicines to the patients, take temperatures, fix ice packs, feed them at “eating time,” rub their back or chest with camphorated sweet oil, make egg-noggs, and a whole string of other things that I can’t begin to name. Male orderlies carried the dead soldiers out on stretchers at the rate of two every three hours. 
Repeated calls come from the Red Cross to do volunteer work right here in D.C.  I volunteered again, but as yet I have not been called and am waiting. They are certainly desperate for nurses—even me can volunteer as a nurse in a camp or in Washington. 
All the schools, churches, theaters, dancing halls, etc. are closed here also. There is a bill today in the Senate authorizing all the wartime government workers to stay home for the duration of the epidemic. It has not passed the House of Representatives yet, but I can’t help but hope it does.

Recorded in the History of the Discovery and Conquest of India by the Portuguese by Fernão Lopes de Castanheda, a Portuguese historian, published in 1551. 
Your Majesty: we are astonished that you should lower yourself by receiving these Portuguese enemies into your kingdom, who seem to be pirates rather than merchants. We, your Muslim subjects, have always been loyal to you and have brought valuable foreign merchandise to this country and have exported its native products to increase your revenue greatly. You appear to forget all this, by receiving those newcomers into your favor as if your own numerous and faithful subjects were incompetent for the purpose. In this you dishonor yourself, and embolden these strangers to hold your power in contempt. 
The true intent of the Portuguese in coming into these seas is to take possession of your city, and not to trade for spices as they pretend. The place you have given them for a trading post, they will convert into a fort, from where they will make war on you when you least expect it. We say these things to you out of good will rather than out of any desire for profit; for if you do not listen to our advice, there are other cities on India’s Malabar Coast from which we can conduct our trade in spices.

The Muslims in Calicut are rich, and live well, and they used to control all the sea trade from that town. Indeed, if the king of Portugal had not discovered India, Malabar would already have been in the hands of the Muslims. 
In addition to the local Muslims, there are also foreign Muslims in Calicut such as Arabs, Persians, and Gujaratis. They are great merchants, sail to all parts of the world with their goods, and have their own Muslim leader who rules over them and disciplines them as necessary, without the Hindu king of Calicut meddling with them. And before the king of Portugal discovered the country, the Muslim traders were so numerous and powerful in the city of Calicut that the Hindus did not dare to enter into disputes with them. 
And after the king of Portugal made himself master there, and these Muslims saw that they could not defend their position there, they began to leave Calicut, so that very few of them remain today.

Source: Anonymous Portuguese court official’s letter of advice to King Sebastian of Portugal regarding a proposal to conclude a peace treaty and establish free trade with the Ottoman Empire, mid-1560s. 
If the Turks were allowed to travel freely to India, and establish their own trading-posts, and trade in merchandise wherever they wished, Your Majesty’s own profits would suffer greatly. If that were to happen, all of the business handled by our merchants would immediately fall to the Turks because their empire is much closer to India. The duration of their voyages, their transportation costs, the risks they would face, and the damage they would sustain to their ships and their merchandise would be less than half of that suffered by our own ships. 
Portugal’s state monopoly in pepper and other controlled spices would also be threatened by allowing the Turks to establish trade in India. Even now, when they have not been able to openly compete against us, it is known that they conduct trade in secret, carrying spices to Persia, Bengal, Southeast Asia, and China, and especially to their own markets, despite our efforts to stop them. 
Thus, if the Turks are allowed to operate freely, their ties with local Muslims would make them even better informed and better organized than us, so that they could send as much pepper as they wanted by means of the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, and become masters of the lion’s share of the trade in spices.

It is our firm belief that if your Majesty better understood the circumstances of Aceh and our long struggle against the miserable Portuguese infidels, your Imperial compassion would be awakened. As you know, the pilgrim and merchant vessels from all the ports of Indonesia must pass through the Maldive Islands on their way to Mecca and the Red Sea, and between all 24,000 Maldive Islands, there are just four channels where a ship can pass safely. The infidel Portuguese wait around the entrances of these channels. When our ships arrive there, the Portuguese stop and take possession of as many as they can. Any ship they cannot capture they sink with cannon fire, either leaving the Muslims aboard to drown, or capturing and enslaving them. 
The Portuguese have even dared attack Ottoman ships belonging to your Majesty. For example, in the year 1565, your officials came to Aceh and left for Istanbul loaded with pepper, silk, cinnamon, cloves, and other products from Indonesia. Portuguese vessels intercepted the ship at the Maldives and sank it. Five hundred Muslims drowned and the rest were enslaved. 
So, we request that your Imperial Majesty grant us siege cannons and ask that you instruct the Ottoman governors of Egypt and Aden to allow our representatives to come to your Majesty’s illustrious court and obtain all the horses, armor, and other weapons that we will need for our defense against the Portuguese.

After the Portuguese had established themselves in Cochin on the Malabar Coast, they forced every vessel, however small, to carry a safe conduct pass, which was issued for a certain fee. The Portuguese, in imposing this toll, claimed that it would improve commerce. To enforce the toll, they seized the cargo and crew of any ship that did not have its pass! 
In addition to this system of persecution, the Portuguese deployed ships all over the Indian Ocean to lie in wait and intercept vessels. In this way, they unjustly acquired vast wealth and captured countless prisoners. 
Soon, as a result of his lengthy conflict with the Portuguese, the ruler of our city of Calicut almost entirely exhausted his treasure and resources and his kingdom became strained to the limit. Because he was tired of war, the prince entered into a treaty in 1515 allowing the Portuguese to build a fort in Calicut in exchange for allowing his subjects to send four ships every year to Arabian ports. Afterward, the Portuguese set about building their fortifications, while the merchants of Calicut prepared four ships loaded with pepper and ginger for dispatch to the Arabian coast and, at the same time, resumed trading with Gujarat and other foreign ports while carrying with them the passes from the Portuguese.

In the city of Cambay in northwestern India, Hindu brokers of great authority have traditionally handled all transactions at the port, and the Portuguese merchants observe this custom. Every foreign merchant who does business in the country has his own broker who works with him in buying and selling his merchandise. When a new fleet of ships sails into port at Cambay, the brokers come to the dock and the foreign merchants give them all their cargo. The merchants carefully note all the bundles and packs of goods that they are giving to the brokers, and the brokers command their servants to take the merchants and lodge them in one of the many houses kept for this purpose; the broker says to the merchant, “Go and take your rest, while I conduct your trade.” 
After Goa, Cochin is the most important base the Portuguese have in southwestern India. Much of the merchandise destined for the kingdom of Portugal originates there. Inland from Cochin is the pepper-producing region. But the pepper that goes to Portugal from Cochin is not as good as the pepper that goes to Arabia and Persia because the Portuguese had made a contract with the king of Cochin to buy the pepper at a very low price. Because of that, the Indian pepper growers bring their worst produce to the Portuguese and sell them pepper that is green and full of filth.

"“Inner [and Central] Asia have long been seen as a zone of contact and transmission, a lengthy conveyor belt on which commercial and cultural wares traveled between the major civilizations of Eurasia. The nomads had an essential but largely unacknowledged role in this cultural traffic. While nomadic empires had as their primary objective the control and exploitation of sedentary subjects, their secondary effect was the creation of numerous opportunities for cross-cultural contact, comparison, and exchange. 
Indeed, although nomads are normally included in the analysis of the political context of trans-Eurasian exchange, they are typically left out of the cultural equation. Here the great sedentary civilizations are placed at center stage, particularly when scientific and cultural transfers are under consideration. But, as we have seen, pastoral nomads were the chief initiators, promoters, and agents of this exchange between East and West [in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries].”

"LIFE EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH COMPARED TO GDP* PER CAPITA, 2005 
The figure presents a scatterplot titled “Life Expectancy at Birth Compared to G D P per Capita, 2005.” Note that G D P is a measurement of a country’s economic production in a given year. The horizontal axis is labeled “G D P per Capita,” and the numbers 0 through 50,000, in increments of 5,000, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Life Expectancy at Birth, in years,” and the numbers 30 through 90, in increments of 10, are indicated. There are many data points in the scatterplot. They begin around a life expectancy of 40 years, very close to the vertical axis, and trend almost vertically upward and slightly to the right at first until they reach a G D P per Capita of approximately 6,000 and a life expectancy of approximately 75 years. From here, the data points trend almost horizontally to the right, but slightly upward, until they end at a G D P per Capita of approximately 42,000 and a life expectancy of 77 years. Nineteen data points have countries provided as labels. From left to right, and top to bottom, the data for each country are as follows. Note that all values are approximate.
