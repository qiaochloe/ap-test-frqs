"Source: The Chronicle of Zuo, one of the earliest Chinese historical works, composed during the Warring States period, circa 350 B.C.E. An ambassador from another [Chinese] state desired a jade ring that belonged to a merchant who resided in the Chinese state of Lu. So the ambassador begged Zi Chan, a Lu official, to have the ring confiscated from the merchant and given to him. Zi Chan, however, refused, saying, “One of our ancient rulers made a pact with the merchants in our state, to last through all generations. The pact said, ‘If you do not revolt against me [the ruler], I will not violently interfere with your commerce. I will not beg or take anything from you, and you may have your profitable markets, precious things, and substance, without my taking any knowledge of them.’ Through this attested covenant, our rulers and the merchants who live in our territory have preserved their mutual relations down to the present day. If you get the jade and lose a friendly state, wouldn’t that be a mistake?” The ambassador then changed his mind, saying, “I presumed in my stupidity to ask for the jade, which would have occasioned such a calamity. Let me now withdraw my request.”",1,DBQ,1,2017,ap-world-history-frq-2017.txt

"Source: Marcus Tullius Cicero, Roman statesman and philosopher, An Essay about Duties, circa 50 B.C.E. We generally accept as true the following statements about trade and occupations, in regard to which are suitable for gentlemen and which are vulgar. First, those occupations are condemned, which bring upon you peoples’ hatred, such as tax collecting and moneylending. Also vulgar and unsuitable for gentlemen are the occupations of all hired workmen whom we pay for their labor, not for their artistic skills. Also to be considered vulgar are retail merchants, who buy from wholesale merchants and immediately turn around and resell; for they would not make a profit unless they lied a lot. Of all the occupations from which profit is accrued, none is better than agriculture, none more profitable, none more delightful, none more suitable to a free man.... When Cato [a Roman statesman well-known for his moral integrity] was asked what was the best form of property ownership he replied. “Raising livestock with great success.” And after that? “Raising livestock with little success.” And third? “Raising crops.” And when the person asking the questions said, “What about moneylending?” Cato replied, “What about murder?”",3,DBQ,1,2017,ap-world-history-frq-2017.txt

The blessed Melania [383–438 C.E.] and her husband Pinian both came from foremost [Roman] families of senatorial rank. But they resolved to abandon their frivolous and worldly mode of life and experience an angelic, heavenly purpose. They left the great city of Rome and went to their suburban estate, where they devoted themselves to the practice of the virtues. They knew that it was impossible for them to offer pure worship to God unless they made themselves enemies to the confusions of a wealthy life.... [Melania described their estate in the following manner:] “It was an extraordinary piece of property and in it stood a bath that surpassed any other in worldly splendor. The estate had a total of sixty-two settlements within its borders, with four hundred slaves. But I knew that it was the Devil who set before me those multicolored marbles, the villa, and all that inestimable revenue.” So the blessed ones fearlessly gave away all their possessions, which were enough for the entire world. They established monasteries of monks and nuns, furnishing each place with a sufficient amount of gold.

Ever since the British introduced the noble game of cricket among the natives of Bombay nearly twenty years ago, more than five hundred young men of all ages and of all castes pursue this healthful sport on the Parade ground where alone they are permitted to play and which is the only ground suitable for cricket. Therefore, we cannot understand that the comforts and convenience of the half-a-dozen English gentlemen, who generally play polo, should be preferred to the necessary healthful recreation of over five hundred native youths. The polo ponies completely ruin the turf and render the ground unsuited to cricket. Under the circumstances, will your Excellency and council please request that the English play polo on another spot or allow your Petitioners to play along with the English on the ground at present reserved for the exclusive use of the English cricketers and which is much too large for their requirements?",1,DBQ,1,2012,ap12_frq_world_history.txt

Income from the farms provides for the family needs and subsistence of the parents and siblings. The person who takes employment in the factory is an unattached component of the family.

Unless an alternative way, other than the Suez Canal controlled by the British, is found to connect the holy cities [of Mecca and Medina] to the rest of the empire, the Red Sea coast of Arabia might fall prey to the evils of those who strive to overthrow the very foundations of the caliphate.* At present, Muslims going on pilgrimage must either use foreign ships, where they are subjected to humiliation, or travel by camel, a very challenging journey through months of drought. It has become necessary to construct a railway in this region, both to solve these problems and to show the power of the caliph. The railway has to be built solely by Muslim involvement, by obtaining a huge amount of finance from the Islamic world and recruiting Muslim engineers in its construction. Our sultan must personally lead this highly significant undertaking. Muslims across the world hold our sultan in very high regard; therefore people of political and economic influence will not hesitate to allocate some of their assets to this cause when they see our sultan personally leading the initiative. *The Ottoman sultan claimed the title of caliph of all Muslims.",3,DBQ,1,2018,ap18-frq-world-history.txt

Since the Great Wall of China the world has never seen an undertaking of equal magnitude. Russia, single-handedly, has conceived it and carried it out. Its strategic results are already easy to foresee. It will consolidate Russian influence in the Far East in a manner yet undreamed of. But this will be by slow steps. The expectation that the railroad could be used to transport masses of soldiers from European Russia to China, either in response to an attack or for Russia herself to launch an attack, is yet far from becoming reality. The line and its organization would break down utterly under such pressure. But bit by bit it will grow in capacity, and the Powers that have enormous interests at stake in the Far East, if they continue to sleep as England has done of late, will wake to find a new, solid, impenetrable, self-sufficient Russia dominating China as she has dominated, sooner or later, every other Oriental land against whose frontier she has laid her own.",5,DBQ,1,2018,ap18-frq-world-history.txt

He chose not to follow the life of a husbandman, but rather to study, learn and exercise the rudiment of more subtle conceptions. For this reason, aspiring to the merchant’s trade, he began to follow the chapman’s [peddler’s] way of life, first learning how to gain in small bargains and things of insignificant price; and to gain from things of greater expense. Thus aspiring ever higher and higher, and yearning upward with his whole heart, at length his great labors and cares bore much fruit of worldly gain. For he labored not only as a merchant but also as a shipman to Denmark and Flanders and Scotland; in all which lands he found certain rare, and therefore more precious, wares, which he carried to other parts wherein he knew them to be least familiar, and coveted by the inhabitants beyond the price of gold itself; wherefore he exchanged these wares for others coveted by men of other lands; and thus chaffered [bargained] most freely and assiduously. Hence he made great profit in all his bargains, and gathered much wealth in the sweat of his brow; for he sold dear in one place the wares which he had bought elsewhere at a small price. [But later] he began to yearn for solitude, and to hold his merchandise in less esteem than heretofore. And now he had lived sixteen years as a merchant, and began to think of spending on charity, to God’s honor and service, the goods which he had so laboriously acquired. He therefore took the cross as a pilgrim to Jerusalem. Godric was now already firmly disposed to give himself entirely to God’s service. Wherefore, that he might follow Christ the more freely, he sold all his possessions and distributed them among the poor. For above all things he coveted the life of a hermit.",3,DBQ,1,2002,world_hist_frq_02_10374.txt

But no man wishes to buy a thing for more than its worth. Therefore no man should sell a thing to another man for more than its worth. I answer that it is altogether sinful to have recourse to deceit in order to sell a thing for more than its just price, because this is to deceive one’s neighbor so as to injure him. Hence Tully [Cicero, the Roman writer] says: Contracts should be entirely free from double-dealing: the seller must not impose upon the bidder, nor the buyer upon one that bids against him. Therefore if either the price exceed the quantity of the thing’s worth, or, conversely, the thing exceed the price, there is no longer the equality of justice: and consequently, to sell a thing for more than its worth, or to buy it for less than its worth, is in itself unjust and unlawful.

"Source: Ibn Khaldun, leading Muslim scholar, Universal History (Kitab al-ibar), fourteenth century. Commerce is the increasing of capital by buying goods and attempting to sell them at a price higher than their cost. This is done either by waiting for a rise in the market price; or by transporting the goods to another place where they are more keenly demanded and therefore fetch a higher price; or, lastly, by selling them on a long-term credit basis. Commercial profit is small, relatively to the capital invested, but if the capital is large, even a low rate of profit will produce a large total gain. In order to achieve this increase in capital, it is necessary to have enough initial capital to pay in cash the sellers from whom one buys goods; it is also necessary to sell for cash, as honesty is not widespread among people. This dishonesty leads on the one hand to fraud and the adulteration of goods, and on the other to delays on payment which diminish profits because capital remains idle during the interval. It also induces buyers to repudiate their debts, a practice which is very injurious to the merchant’s capital. The manners of tradesmen are inferior to those of rulers, and far removed from manliness and uprightness. We have already stated that traders must buy and sell and seek profits. This necessitates flattery, and evasiveness, litigation and disputation, all of which are characteristic of this profession. And these qualities lead to a decrease and weakening in virtue and manliness. For these acts inevitably affect the soul. As for Trade, although it be a natural means of livelihood, yet most of the methods it employs are tricks aimed at making a profit by securing the difference between the buying and selling prices, and by appropriating the surplus. This is why [religious] Law allows the use of such methods, which, although they come under the heading of gambling, yet do not constitute the taking without return of other people’s goods.",5,DBQ,1,2002,world_hist_frq_02_10374.txt

When I go to see the British commander and say to him that some of our comrades are dead, instead of mourning their death, as our French brothers do, he laughs at us. If I ask for anything for our sick, he refuses and replies that he has no use for us. From all this you can well see that they are seeking our ruin.

If the Muslims do not take to the system of education introduced by the British, they will not only remain a backward community, but will sink lower and lower until there will be no hope of recovery left to them. If the choice were to lie between giving up and preserving Islam, I would have unhesitatingly chosen Islam. That, however, is not the choice. The adoption of the new system of education does not mean the renunciation of Islam. It means its protection. We are justly proud of the achievements of our forefathers in the fields of learning and culture, but these achievements were possible only because they were willing to act upon the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. The Prophet said that knowledge is the heritage of the believer and that he should acquire it wherever he can find it. He also said that the Muslims should seek knowledge even if they have to go to China, which at that time was one of the most civilized countries in the world, but it was a non-Muslim country and could not teach the Muslims anything about their own religion. Did the early Muslims not take to Greek learning avidly? Did this in any respect undermine their loyalty to Islam? Europe has made such remarkable progress in science that it would be suicidal not to make an effort to acquire that knowledge.

"Source: Dr. Vandana Shiva, Indian physicist, from her article in the Ecologist, an environmental affairs magazine, 1991. The Green Revolution has been a failure. It has led to reduced genetic diversity, increased vulnerability to pests, soil erosion, water shortages, reduced soil fertility, micronutrient deficiencies, soil contamination, reduced availability of nutritious food crops for the local population, the displacement of vast numbers of small farmers from their land, rural impoverishment, and increased tensions and conflicts. The beneficiaries have been the agrochemical industry, large petrochemical companies, manufacturers of agricultural machinery, dam builders, and large landowners. The Punjab is frequently cited as the Green Revolution’s most celebrated success story. Yet, far from bringing prosperity, two decades of the Green Revolution have left the Punjab riddled with discontent and violence. Instead of abundance, the Punjab is beset with diseased soils, pest-infested crops, waterlogged deserts, and indebted and discontented farmers. Instead of peace, the Punjab has inherited conflict and violence. Traditionally, irrigation was only used in the Punjab as an insurance against crop failure in times of severe drought. The new seeds, however, need intensive irrigation as an essential input for crop yields. One result of the Green Revolution has therefore been to create conflicts over diminishing water resources. Intensive irrigation has led to the need for large-scale storage systems, centralizing control over water supplies and leading to both local and interstate water conflicts. © Vandana Shiva.

The government is not indifferent to the evils afflicting the working class of the Republic: if their wages are inadequate or if they lack employment, the first one to regret this situation is the president. However, these are private ills that fall largely beyond the government’s power to correct. Such is the case, unfortunately, of the problems that afflict the working class that you so honorably represent. Given the laws that govern our country, the government cannot restrict the freedom of factory owners to fire or hire workers, nor can it intervene directly in the improvement of basic working conditions. No laws permit this nor do any economic interests oblige the government to dictate salaries, or prices, or working hours. In your demands, you invoke the right to work. But this right also implies the obligation to find jobs. It cannot be the government’s responsibility to supply workers with jobs, or to compel anyone else to supply them.

The owners of these great plantations are the chief slave-holders of Yucatan and the plantation workers are the slaves. The slaves are 8,000 Yaqui Indians imported from Northern Mexico, 3,000 Chinese and Koreans, and between 100,000 and 125,000 native Mayas, who formerly owned the lands that the henequen planters now own. The planters do not call their workers “slaves” especially when speaking to strangers. They do not call their system slavery; they call it enforced service for debt. At first I thought it would not be so bad if the servant had an opportunity of buying back his freedom. But I found that such was not the custom. “You need have no fear in purchasing this plantation,” one owner said to me, “of the laborers being able to buy their freedom and leave you. They can never do that.” “It is very easy to recruit workers,” another planter told me. “All that is necessary is that you get some free laborer in debt to you, and then you have him.

The right of property is an absurd right because it had its origins in crime, fraud, and abuse of power. In the past, land was worked in common, forests provided firewood to the hearths of all, harvests were distributed among the members of the community according to their needs. In Mexico, this custom thrived in indigenous communities in the era of Spanish domination and existed until recently. The attempt to take away the common lands of indigenous communities caused the recent Yaqui Wars in Sonora and the troubles with the Mayas in the Yucatan. The return of the land to the peasants should be accomplished during the present uprising. We revolutionaries will not be committing a crime by turning over the land to the working people, because, by natural law, it already belongs to them. It is the land that their ancestors watered with their sweat; the land that the Spaniards robbed by force from our Indian fathers. That land belongs to all Mexicans. Some of those who own the land currently might have bought it; others might have acquired the land by taking advantage of their friendship with corrupt government officials.

"“While the world revolution of Westernization [after 1850] created a political world order radically different from all past human experience, it also disrupted the non-Western societies constituting the bulk of humanity. . . . The Westerners with their sense of mission also introduced their education. Along the way [Western-educated intellectuals from non-Western societies] soon acquired a taste for the dominant ideals of the West, especially the liberal plea for equality, freedom, and self-determination and the socialists’ cry for social justice for all exploited and oppressed peoples and classes.... Inevitably, the non-Western intellectuals turned their lessons to their own use. The ideals of freedom and self-determination justified protests over the humiliation of their countries and cultures. As a result of their Westernization they became anti-Western nationalists, caught in a love-hate attitude toward the West....

The merchants carefully note all the bundles and packs of goods that they are giving to the brokers, and the brokers command their servants to take the merchants and lodge them in one of the many houses kept for this purpose; the broker says to the merchant, “Go and take your rest, while I conduct your trade.” After Goa, Cochin is the most important base the Portuguese have in southwestern India. Much of the merchandise destined for the kingdom of Portugal originates there. Inland from Cochin is the pepper-producing region. But the pepper that goes to Portugal from Cochin is not as good as the pepper that goes to Arabia and Persia because the Portuguese had made a contract with the king of Cochin to buy the pepper at a very low price. Because of that, the Indian pepper growers bring their worst produce to the Portuguese and sell them pepper that is green and full of filth.",6,DBQ,1,2019,ap19-frq-world-history.txt
"The figure presents a photograph of a decorative box with a number of inlaid patterns and images. On the front of the box, is a decorative scene that shows a white man hunting with a rifle. A tiger is also shown taking down what appears to be an antelope, while two other antelope run away as birds fly overhead. These scenes are included in the midst of an inlaid floral pattern.© Cynthia Hazen Polsky and Leon B. Polsky Fund, 2000",7,DBQ,1,2019,ap19-frq-world-history.txt
"“Inner [and Central] Asia have long been seen as a zone of contact and transmission, a lengthy conveyor belt on which commercial and cultural wares traveled between the major civilizations of Eurasia. The nomads had an essential but largely unacknowledged role in this cultural traffic. While nomadic empires had as their primary objective the control and exploitation of sedentary subjects, their secondary effect was the creation of numerous opportunities for cross-cultural contact, comparison, and exchange. Indeed, although nomads are normally included in the analysis of the political context of trans-Eurasian exchange, they are typically left out of the cultural equation. Here the great sedentary civilizations are placed at center stage, particularly when scientific and cultural transfers are under consideration. But, as we have seen, pastoral nomads were the chief initiators, promoters, and agents of this exchange between East and West [in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries].” Thomas Allsen, historian, Culture and Conquest, 2001 Reprinted with the permission of Cambridge University Press.",0,SAQ,1,2019,ap19-frq-world-history.txt
"LIFE EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH COMPARED TO GDP* PER CAPITA, 2005 The figure presents a scatterplot titled “Life Expectancy at Birth Compared to G D P per Capita, 2005.” Note that G D P is a measurement of a country’s economic production in a given year. The horizontal axis is labeled “G D P per Capita,” and the numbers 0 through 50,000, in increments of 5,000, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Life Expectancy at Birth, in years,” and the numbers 30 through 90, in increments of 10, are indicated. There are many data points in the scatterplot. They begin around a life expectancy of 40 years, very close to the vertical axis, and trend almost vertically upward and slightly to the right at first until they reach a G D P per Capita of approximately 6,000 and a life expectancy of approximately 75 years. From here, the data points trend almost horizontally to the right, but slightly upward, until they end at a G D P per Capita of approximately 42,000 and a life expectancy of 77 years. Nineteen data points have countries provided as labels. From left to right, and top to bottom, the data for each country are as follows. Note that all values are approximate.Swaziland.
