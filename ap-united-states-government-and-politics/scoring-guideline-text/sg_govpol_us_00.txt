Valeo (1976) Description: Supreme Court struck down certain campaign donation limits and spending limits as violation of free expression provisions of 1st Amendment Explanation: &#1; Contributing to one’s own campaign, contributing to parties for party building, and spending money independently of a campaign are forms of protected free expression. &#1; A constitutional amendment is required to limit free expression, not a more easily enacted statute. • Soft Money Description: unregulated donations to political parties for party activities/party building; usually spent in the states to aid candidates indirectly in various ways Explanation: &#1; Both parties benefit from soft money, so partisan members of Congress and presidents have little incentive to regulate this resource;  there is no critical policy-making mass for reform &#1; Interest groups are often the contributors of these funds, perceive benefits from their use, and have no incentive to urge office seekers or incumbents with whom they have a relationship to regulate these monies. •Incumbency Description: an office holder who is pursuing reelection Explanation: &#1; Incumbents benefit most from existing campaign finance laws &#1; Incumbents have a high probability of re-election and thus attract more donations than challengers, which gives them a desirable advantage in re-election contests. &#1; Incumbents know the consequences of current policy, find them favorable, and realize that changes may created unanticipated negative consequences for themselves. NOTES: (1) This discussion is necessarily set in the context of federal elections (presidency and Congress). (2) One or both points may be earned for the explanation without earning the description point, although earning one such point will likely be unusual, and two points rare. (3) Independent expenditures are NOT considered soft money
