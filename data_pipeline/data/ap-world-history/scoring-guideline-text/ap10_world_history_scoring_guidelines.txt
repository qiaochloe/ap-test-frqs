Has acceptable thesis.         1 Point • The thesis must explicitly state at least one similarity and one difference in the characteristics of the mechanization of the cotton industry in Japan and India as evidenced in the documents. • The thesis must be explicitly stated in the introduction or the specified conclusion of the essay. • The thesis may appear as one sentence or multiple sentences. • A thesis that is split among multiple paragraphs is unacceptable. • A thesis that merely restates the prompt is unacceptable. • Thesis statements such as “there were more similarities than differences” are not   acceptable. • The thesis CANNOT count for any other point.  2. Understands the basic meaning of documents.      1 Point (May misinterpret one document.) • Students must address all 10 of the documents. • Students must demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of at least nine documents. • Students may demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of a document by grouping it in regard to a specified characteristic of the mechanization of the cotton industry. • Restating or quoting the content of the documents separately does not adequately demonstrate an understanding of basic meaning.  3. Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from all or all but one document. 2 Points For 2 points: • Specific and accurate evidence of a characteristic of the mechanization of the cotton industry must be explicitly drawn from a minimum of nine documents. • A document that is simply listed cannot count as evidence.       For 1 point: • Specific and accurate evidence of a characteristic of the mechanization of the cotton industry must be explicitly drawn from a minimum of eight documents. • A document that is simply listed cannot count as evidence.  4. Analyzes point of view in at least two documents.     1 Point • Students must correctly analyze point of view in at least two documents.  Point of view explains why this particular person might have this particular opinion or what particular feature informs the author’s point of view.  Students must move beyond mere description by identifying a plausible tone, the characteristics of the author, the intended audience, and/or how the intended outcome may have influenced the author’s opinion.  Students may challenge the veracity of the author’s opinion or point of view but must move beyond a mere statement of “bias” by providing some plausible analysis.  Mere attribution is not sufficient. Attribution is copying or repeating information verbatim from the source line of the document. Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  5. Analyzes documents by grouping them in three ways.    1 Point • Students must explicitly and correctly group the documents in three ways. • A minimum of two documents (used appropriately) constitutes a group or subgroup. • Students may not receive credit for both the larger group and the subgroups within it. • No comparison within the paragraph or thesis is necessary to earn the grouping point. • Groupings must coherently address the characteristics of the mechanization of the cotton industry. Examples of such groupings include:  The growth of mechanization  Dominance of female labor in Japan  Dominance of male labor in India  A comparison of male and female labor between India and Japan   Peasant labor in Japan  Peasant labor in both India and Japan  Rural–urban migrations  Ex–handloom weavers in India  Differences between sources of labor (handloom versus peasant)  Harsh conditions of labor  Low wages  Beneficial and negative consequences of mechanization  6. Identifies and explains the need for one type of appropriate additional  document or source.           1 Point • Students must identify an appropriate additional document, source or voice and explain how the document or source will contribute to their analysis of the characteristics of the mechanization of the cotton industry.   Subtotal           7 Points   EXPANDED CORE (excellence)        0–2 Points Expands beyond basic core of 1–7 points. A student must earn 7 points in the basic core area before earning points in the expanded core area.  Examples: • Provides more than one similarity and difference. • Provides consistent comparative analysis throughout the essay. • Has a clear, analytical and comprehensive thesis.  Goes well beyond the minimally acceptable thesis. • Shows careful and insightful analysis of the documents.  Recognizes the historical context of the documents.  Analyzes all 10 documents.  Explains corroboration and links between documents. • Uses documents persuasively as evidence. • Analyzes point of view in most or all documents.  Provides thoughtful analysis of author’s background, intended audience, tone or historical context. Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  • Includes groupings beyond the three required. • Brings in accurate and relevant “outside” historical content. • Explains why additional types of document(s) or sources are needed.  Identifies more than one type of appropriate additional document.  Provides a sophisticated explanation of why the additional document is necessary.  Request for additional document is woven into the essay and integrated into a broader analysis.  Subtotal            2 Points  TOTAL           9 Points  Question 2 — Continuity/Change over Time  Note: Essay does not have to address both beliefs and practices.  BASIC CORE (competence)         0–7 Points  1. Has acceptable thesis.         1 Point • The thesis correctly specifies BOTH continuity and change in religion from 1450 to the present. • Thesis must be explicitly stated in the introduction or the specified conclusion of the essay. • The thesis may appear as one sentence or multiple sentences. • A thesis that is split among multiple paragraphs or merely restates the prompt is unacceptable. For example, “There were many continuities and changes … ” is not acceptable.  • “Practices” is meant to be interpreted broadly (e.g., role of religion in politics). • Beliefs and practices can be treated together. • The thesis CANNOT count for any other point.  2. Addresses all parts of the question, though not necessarily evenly or        thoroughly.          2 Points For 2 points: • Essay addresses BOTH continuity AND change in religious beliefs and practices    with historically relevant specificity.  For 1 point: • Addresses continuity OR change in religious beliefs and practices but not BOTH. • “Addressing … ” CANNOT count as any other point.  3. Substantiates thesis with appropriate historical evidence.   2 Points For 2 points: • Provides at least five pieces of historically accurate evidence of continuity AND change in patterns of religious beliefs and practices.   Each piece of evidence must be a supporting example of continuity OR change in patterns of religious beliefs and practices.  Examples: practice of indigenous religions in 1450 and its continuation; impact of monotheism in Latin America/Caribbean; end of human sacrifice in Latin America; spread of Islam in sub-Saharan Africa; introduction of Christianity to new areas of sub-Saharan Africa; less practice of indigenous religions. For 1 point:                                  • Partially substantiates thesis with appropriate historical evidence.  Provides at least four pieces of accurate evidence of continuity AND/OR change in patterns of religious beliefs and practices.  4. Uses relevant world historic context effectively to explain continuity and  change over time.         1 Point • Essay relates or describes extraregional (e.g., North Africa or Europe) connection or a global process (e.g., slave trade or expansion of trade networks) to explain continuity or change in patterns of religious beliefs and practices.  Using “relevant world historical context” CANNOT count for the analysis point (#5) but can be included in the evidence count (#2), if appropriate. Question 2 — Continuity/Change over Time (continued)  5. Analyzes the process of continuity and change over time.   1 Point • Accurately explains reason for or impact of a continuity OR a change in patterns of religious belief and practice. • “Analyzes … ” CANNOT count for “uses relevant world historical context” (#4) but can be included in the evidence count (#2), if appropriate.  Subtotal           7 Points   EXPANDED CORE (excellence)        0–2 Points Expands beyond basic core of 1–7 points. A student must earn 7 points in the basic core area before earning points in the expanded core area.  Examples: • Has a clear, analytical and comprehensive thesis. • Analyzes all issues of the question (as relevant): global context, chronology, causation, change, continuity, effects, content.  • Provides ample historical evidence to substantiate thesis. • Provides links with relevant ideas, events and trends in an innovative way.  Subtotal           2 Points  TOTAL           9 Points Question 3 — Comparative  BASIC CORE (competence)         0–7 Points  1.

Addresses all parts of the question, though not necessarily evenly or  thoroughly.          2 Points For 2 points: • Identifies at least one valid similarity and one valid difference in methods of political control. • Discusses two empires but not necessarily evenly.         For 1 point:  • Identifies at least one valid similarity or at least one valid difference in methods of political control.  • Discusses two empires but not necessarily evenly.  3. Substantiates thesis with appropriate historical evidence.   2 Points For 2 points: • Must provide at least five specific pieces of evidence (at least two from each empire). • Evidence must be within the designated time periods (e.g., evidence from the Roman Republic or Qin dynasty is not acceptable).  For 1 point: • Must provide at least three specific pieces of evidence (at least one from each empire). • Evidence must be within the designated time periods.    4. Makes at least one direct, relevant comparison between/among societies. 1 Point (The direct comparison may discuss either similarities or differences.) • To earn this point, the comparison must be made somewhere other than in the thesis.  5. Analyzes at least one reason for a similarity or a difference identified in  a direct comparison.         1 Point • Analysis (reason why) must be related to a similarity or a difference in methods of political control between the two empires.  Subtotal           7 Points Question 3 — Comparative (continued)  EXPANDED CORE (excellence) 0–2 Points Expands beyond basic core of 1–7 points.
