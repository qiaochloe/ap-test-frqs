Understands the basic meaning of documents.   • Students must address all nine of the documents.  • Students must demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of at least eight documents. • Students may demonstrate the basic meaning of a document by grouping it in regard to a relationship between Chinese peasants and the Chinese Communist Party. • Merely restating verbatim or quoting the content of the documents without context does not adequately demonstrate an understanding of basic meaning.  3. Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from all or all but one document.         For 2 points: • Specific and accurate evidence of a relationship between Chinese peasants and the Chinese Communist Party.

Analyzes point of view in at least two documents.  Students must correctly analyze point of view in at least two documents. • Point of view explains why this individual might have this opinion or what feature informs the author’s point of view. • Students must move beyond mere description by explaining a document’s tone, the characteristics of the author, the intended audience, or how the intended outcome may have influenced the author’s opinion (or some combination of these).  • Students may challenge the veracity of the author’s opinion or point of view, but they must move beyond a mere statement that the author is “biased” by providing some plausible analysis of how or why. • Mere attribution is not sufficient. Attribution is copying or repeating information verbatim from the source line of the document..   0–7 Points  1 Point           1 Points          2 Points     1 Point        1 Point             Question 1 (continued)   5.
