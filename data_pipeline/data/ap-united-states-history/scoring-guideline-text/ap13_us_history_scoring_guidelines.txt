As to the doctrine of slavery and the right of Christians to hold Africans in perpetual servitude, and sell and treat them as we do our horses and cattle, that (it is true) has been [formerly] countenanced by the . . . laws . . . but . . . a different idea has taken place with the people of America, more favorable to the natural rights of mankind, and to that natural, innate desire of Liberty, with which Heaven (without regard to color, complexion, or shape of noses) . . . has inspired all the human race. And upon this ground our . . . Government, by which the people of this Commonwealth have solemnly bound themselves, sets out with declaring that all men are born free and equal—and that every subject is entitled to liberty, and to have it guarded by the laws, as well as life and property—and in short is totally repugnant to the idea of being born slaves.  Document Information  • The doctrine of slavery holds Africans in perpetual slavery as animals. • The Massachusetts Supreme Court decision upholds the abolition of slavery. • The natural rights of life and liberty are protected for all citizens in the Massachusetts Commonwealth. • All men, regardless of race or physical attributes, are equal.   Document Inferences  • The American Revolution created a sense of egalitarianism and a new ideal of government grounded in liberty and the natural rights of man. • The legal system of Massachusetts codified an opposition to slavery. • A growing opposition to slavery based on political ideals was emerging in the North. • States rather than a national government were taking the lead on extending emancipation to slaves. • Growing legal challenges to slavery.  Potential Outside Information  Amistad case Nancy Jackson case Elizabeth “Mum Bet” Freeman case  Prigg v.

The bearer of this letter, the Reverend Mr. Gloucester, an [African American] ordained minister of the Presbyterian Church, visits your town in order to obtain pecuniary aid to enable him to purchase the freedom of his wife and children, for which the extravagant sum of 1,500 dollars has been demanded by their master and mistress. The friends of religion and of the poor Africans in Philadelphia have sent 500 dollars to them for that purpose and have subscribed liberally towards building him a church. At present he preaches to crowds of his African brethren in a schoolhouse every Sunday, and to great acceptance. The prospects of his usefulness to them are very great.  . . . By the present census it appears that the blacks in our city will amount to more than 2,000 souls. Their late great increase is from migration from the southern states.  Document Information  • Shows an influential white American helping an African American minister to purchase his family’s freedom. • Indicates an increase in Philadelphia’s population of free black people. • Shows support within the community to pay for the freedom of a slave family. • Shows the cost of purchasing the freedom of a slave. • Shows an influential white American promoting black ministers for the Presbyterian black churches. • Shows migration of blacks from the South to the North. Document Inferences  • Opponents of slavery were dismayed by the price that slaveholders demanded. • There was a connection between free black people and Protestant churches in the North. • Northerners were aware that blacks, some perhaps slaves or ex-slaves, were fleeing the South and settling in northern cities like Philadelphia. • There were varied ways to be emancipated, one of which was individual purchase. • Black and white communities in the North provided financial support for purchasing freedom of slaves. • Slavery undermined family units. • Development of independent black institutions, such as churches, advocated for emancipation and opposition to slavery. • Philadelphia, New Jersey, and the Mid-Atlantic states were cradles of antislavery and abolitionist sentiment.     Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Potential Outside Information  African American Baptist Church African Methodist Episcopal Church  Free African Society Manumission Societies  Negro Convention Movement Phillips, Wendell  Prince Hall Masons Quaker impulse Tappan, Arthur and Lewis Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Document D  Source: American Colonization Society, petition presented to Congress, February 2, 1820.  The last census shows the number of the free people of color of the United States, and their rapid increase.  . . . The least observation shows that this description of persons are not, and cannot be, either useful or happy among us; and many considerations, which need not be mentioned, prove, beyond dispute, that this is best, for all the parties interested, that there should be a separation . . .  [We] cannot believe that such an evil, universally acknowledged and deprecated, has been irremovably fixed upon us. Some way will always be opened by Providence by which a people desirous of acting justly and benevolently may be led to the attainment of a meritorious object. And [we] believe that . . . the colonization of Africa, in the manner proposed, present[s] the fairest prospects of success.  Document Information  • The American Colonization Society proposes in 1820 that sending free black people to Africa would be best for all interested parties. • The numbers of free black people are growing. • The best solution to the issue of increasing free people of color in the population is separation of the races.  Document Inferences  • Colonization had prominent adherents, including James Monroe, Henry Clay, John Marshall, and Abraham Lincoln. • Colonization was one way for critics of slavery to express their opposition to slavery. • The American Colonization Society advocated financial support for buying slaves’ freedom. • Those supporting the abolition of slavery did not necessarily see free African Americans as equals.  • Anxieties about the increasing free black population grew: over economic competition, cultural differences, and the integration of free black people into the Republic (legal status, citizenship). • Growing opposition to slavery was not always grounded in antislavery or abolitionist sentiment; it was spurred by economic concerns, anxieties over blacks as equals, and fear of slave revolts.  Potential Outside Information  cotton gin  Gabriel Prosser’s Rebellion  Haitian Revolution  King Cotton  Liberia Manumission Societies short staple cotton   Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Document E  Source: William Lloyd Garrison, “Declaration of Sentiments of the American Anti-Slavery Society,” 1833.  With entire confidence in the overruling justice of God, we plant ourselves upon the Declaration of Independence, and upon the truths of Divine Revelation. . . .

If at any one time of my life more than another, I was made to drink the bitterest dregs of slavery, that time was during the first six months of my stay with Mr. Covey [a White overseer]. . . . Mr. Covey succeeded in breaking me. I was broken in body, soul, and spirit. My natural elasticity was crushed, my intellect languished, the disposition to read departed, the cheerful spark that lingered about my eye died; the dark night of slavery closed in upon me; and behold a man transformed into a brute! . . .  Long before daylight, I was called to . . . feed, the horses. . . . Mr. Covey entered the stable with a long rope; and . . . he caught hold of my legs, and was about tying me. . . . I gave a sudden spring, and as I did so, he holding to my legs, I was brought sprawling on the stable floor. Mr. Covey seemed now to think he had me, and could do what he pleased; but at this moment—from whence came the spirit I don’t know—I resolved to fight; and . . . I seized Covey hard by the throat; and as I did so, I rose. He held on to me, and I to him. My resistance was so entirely unexpected that Covey seemed taken all aback. He trembled like a leaf. This gave me assurance. . . .  This battle with Mr. Covey was the turning-point in my career as a slave. It rekindled the few expiring embers of freedom, and revived within me a sense of my own manhood. It recalled the departed self-confidence, and inspired me again with a determination to be free. . . . It was a glorious resurrection, from the tomb of slavery, to the heaven of freedom. My long-crushed spirit rose, cowardice departed, bold defiance took its place.  Document Information  • An African American former slave describes his fight with a white overseer, Mr. Covey. • This fight represents a turning point in his life as a slave, rekindling his desire for freedom. • Slavery destroys a slave’s body, soul, and spirit. Document Inferences  • Douglass was one of the most famous antislavery activists, publishing the North Star. • African Americans actively participated in the antislavery movement. • The antislavery movement gained momentum during the 1830s and 1840s because publications revealed the institution’s cruelties. • Douglass was an effective writer and speaker, which persuaded followers to oppose slavery. • In speeches and narratives, former slaves contradicted the proslavery arguments about slaves’ humanity and intellect. • Some African Americans argued for asserting black manhood through force. • Slaves showed both overt and covert distaste for the institution.    Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Potential  Outside Information  abolitionist speaking tours David Walker’s “An Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World” North Star  Underground Railroad   Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Document H  Source: David Wilmot, speech in Congress, 1847.  I make no war upon the South nor upon slavery in the South.

New England ships carrying rum sailed to Africa, where slaves were brought to the West Indies or Charleston in the Middle Passage, and the West Indies sent sugar and molasses back to New England to make rum. Other variations include manufactured goods from England for colonial tobacco, fish, grain, and naval stores (mast, pitch, tar, and turpentine) and foodstuffs and lumber for sugar, molasses, and slaves from the West Indies:   • encouraged a thriving agricultural economy and exports in the colonies. • merchant networks and shipbuilding. • regional development of particular crops/raw materials. • Atlantic slave trade: West Africa, Caribbean, Western Europe. • growth of cash crops in colonies, use of slave labor; trade of manufactured goods and rum from Europe; molasses and sugar from Caribbean; colonial export of cash crops to Europe, fish and agricultural products to feed slaves in West Indies; slaves from West Africa. • Lords of Trade (1676), Board of Trade (1696). • Columbian Exchange. • protection of trans-Atlantic shipping by British Navy. • naval stores policies (right of naval quartermasters to claim trees and turpentine for ship building—primarily in the Carolinas. Mercantilism  The doctrine, which arose in Europe with the decline of feudalism, that the economic interests of the nation could be strengthened by the government protecting home industries. This could be achieved   through tariffs; by increased foreign trade, such as through monopolies; and by the increase of exports over imports, with a consequent accumulation of bullion. The focus was  to improve national power:   • Maintained that colonies existed to serve the mother country. • Colonies furnished raw materials; mother country manufactured goods. • Enrichment of the mother country benefitted the entire empire; mother country had the right to regulate trade. • Navigation Acts (1651, 1660, 1663, 1696)  Transport their goods only in British and colonial ships in which crews were 75 percent British, even though Dutch freighters offered lower rates.        Question 2 (continued)   Export certain enumerated articles, such as tobacco, sugar, indigo, and furs, only to Britain,although western European markets offered higher prices.  Purchase their imports from Britain or from colonial ships that had secured goods from Europe and stopped at a British port  to pay import duties.  It allowed for methods of enforcing the acts, provided more penalties for evasion, and introduced use of vice-admiralty courts. • Navigation Act II, 1696: special courts in colonies enforced duties to avoid sympathetic colonial judges. • The Staple Act of 1663. • Plantation Duty Act, 1663: colonial customs collectors were to be directly responsible to England’s commissioner of customs, plus certain articles exported from one colony to another were subject to a duty. • Woolen Act of 1699. • Hat Act of 1732. • Molasses Act of 1733. • Iron Act of 1750. • No banks existed in the colonies. • Every year gold and silver was drained from the colonies. • Barter became necessary; butter, nails, pitch, and feathers were used for exchange. •  Until 1763 the Navigation Acts imposed no intolerable burden, partly because they were laxly enforced. • Tobacco farmers enjoyed a monopoly of the market thanks to Britain. Colonists enjoyed the shield of Britain without having to tax themselves; average colonist economically better off than British counterpart.  • Economic initiative was stifled, however colonists often found other means. • Southern colonies were favored: “pets.” • By 1750, one third of all “British” vessels were owned by merchants in New England and the middle colonies. • The expansion of colonial shipping also hastened urbanization by creating a need for centralized docks, warehouses, and repair shops in the colonies. Parliament never restricted grain, livestock, fish, lumber, or rum, which together made up 60 percent of mainland colonial exports. • Tobacco and rice growers were given virtual monopoly. • Steady overseas demand for colonial products spawned a prosperity that enabled white colonists to purchase ever-larger amounts, not only of clothing, but also dishware, furniture, tea, and a range of other imports from Britain and other overseas markets. • Retail shops sprang up in cities, and peddlers took to the countryside.      Question 2 (continued)  • Colonists used timber for building, heating, and cooking. They also sold to the inhabitants of cities and towns. • As colonial prosperity reached new heights, poverty spread in major seaports. Economic development  New England — Port cities formed out of the commercial relationship with England and slave colonies. They produced fish, livestock, and lumber. The shipbuilding industry was also greatly stimulated by the Navigation Acts. So many ships were built for English buyers that by midcentury nearly a third of all British tonnage was American made. Yankees mixed their contraband among legal shipments. By 1750, more than 60 distilleries in Massachusetts Bay were exporting over 2 million gallons of rum, most of it produced from sugar obtained illegally. Because the restrictive rules and regulations enacted by Britain for its colonies were not enforced, the North prospered.  Middle Colonies  — These produced grain, flour, meat, and dairy products. None of these were  included in the list of enumerated goods, thus they could  be sold abroad. They also found markets for these goods in the Lower South and the British West Indies.   Chesapeake and South — These areas  produced tobacco and grain. The plantation system, and  eventually indentured servants, were replaced by slaves from Africa. They enjoyed a monopoly in British markets throughout the world; in addition, the British navy protected them. As time went on they even enjoyed credit from the New England colonies.   • Marked the first seed of what later flowered into colonial resentment towards British restrictions. • Developed trade with Native American population. • Salutary Neglect. • Robert Walpole. • Edmund Burke’s Speech for the “Conciliation with the Colonies.” • American colonists engaged in a wide range of economic pursuits. But except for a few areas in the West where the small white populations subsisted largely on the fur and skin trade with the American Indians, farming dominated all areas of European and African settlement throughout the 17th and 18th centuries.  • Farmers engaged in simple subsistence agriculture, but whenever possible American farmers attempted to grow crops for the local, inter-colonial, and export markets. • 1740s indigo introduced in South Carolina. • Because of the South’s early dependence on large-scale cash crops, the southern colonies developed less of a commercial or industrial economy than the colonies of the North. • Merchants, usually in London and later in the northern colonies, handled the trading of tobacco and rice.       Question 2 (continued)  • The New England colonies’ colder weather and hard, rocky soil made it difficult to develop farming.  • The middle colonies’ fertile land and good climate supplied wheat to much of New England and parts of the South. • Almost every colonist engaged in a certain amount of industry at home. • Domestic efforts included craftsmen and artisans establishing themselves in colonial towns as cobblers, blacksmiths, rifle-makers, cabinets, silversmiths, and printers.

Business titans such as Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller cared little for workers. Work became more dangerous as technology increased speed, complexity, and rate of production. • New chemical developments, especially dyes, bleaches, and cleaning agents, helped spur the textile industry but also made work hazardous. • “Scientific Management,” Frederick W. Taylor, Taylorism. • Mass production also brought benefits: lowered price of goods within reach of average consumers, such as the Model T Ford. Henry Ford offered workers a $5 per day wage. Ford Motor Co. used full moving assembly line production, 1913–1914 (“Fordism” is an extension of Taylorism). The moving assembly line was made possible by advances in grinding and cutting materials that were accurate to 1/1000 of an inch. • Technological innovations in transportation allowed better distribution and made products less expensive, but reduced workers’ control. • Rise of mass entertainment and urban transportation changed social lives of workers. • Creation of amusement parks (Coney Island in New York City, Riverview in Chicago), dance halls, baseball stadiums, and nickelodeons; movies catered to working-class; electric lights and improvements in urban transportation allowed the working class to attend vaudeville theaters at night. • Electric sewing machines allowed for mass production of clothing and encouraged sweatshop labor in garment industry, particularly for immigrants and women. • Industrial waste polluted streams and rivers around many plants; smoke, soot, and ashes polluted the air; middle class responds with city beautiful movements. • Advances in food production (canned meats, refrigeration for fruits and vegetables, pasteurized milk, vitamin fortified cereals from the Kellogg brothers, etc.) meant less malnutrition, even for poor factory workers.       Question 4 (continued)  Middle-Class Urban Residents • Improved urban transportation, such as cable cars, streetcars, electric trolleys, elevated trains, electrical interurban railway, trains, subways, and automobiles allowed workers to live farther from their jobs, giving rise to suburbs; San Francisco cable cars 1873, Richmond first electric trolley line 1888, Boston subway 1897, New York City Subway 1904, and the Hudson Tubes. • Bridges, trolleys, and railroads led to the end of the “walking city” and the rise of the modern suburbs; allowed middle class to move and live away from industry and immigrant ethnic neighborhoods. • Urban areas expanded; consolidation of New York City (1898); by the 1920s the urban population rivaled the rural population in size. • Technology, such as indoor plumbing, water, and sewer systems ameliorated public health and sanitation maladies. • Private bathrooms with toilets and bathtubs became standard in middle class homes. Chain-pull washdown water closets came to the United States from Great Britain in the 1880s. By 1900 flush toilets were made possible by the mass production of enamel coated fixtures. Paper mills began to produce toilet paper. Plumbing advances led to bathtubs and sinks with running water. Before 1880 only luxury hotels and private estates had private indoor bathrooms, but now bathrooms became increasingly common for the middle class. This phenomenon intersects with the rise of germ theory.  • Technology led to better medicine and reduction of deadly diseases such as tuberculosis, which proliferated in overcrowded conditions; medical advances like antiseptic techniques, X-rays, and new drugs, made possible by chemical breakthroughs, improved the health of urban residents. • Mechanized transportation reduced the use of horses, which in turn reduced the presence of horse manure and dead horses in city streets, but led to congestion and safety hazards for pedestrians. • Architectural technology led to tenements, such as dumbbell tenements that could house greater numbers of residents within a small area, although they sometimes contributed to urban squalor. • Mass production and mass consumption created a new middle-class urban culture and increasing expectations for middle class women to consume and display items. Feminists like Charlotte Perkins Gilman criticized this new role, calling such women “parasites.” • Technological changes in consumer goods resulted in lower prices for consumer goods, a greater variety and more goods available to middle class.  Canned processed foods and tobacco were less expensive and more available.  Refrigerated railroad cars made fresh fruits and vegetables more available and less expensive.  New machines could peel fruits and vegetables and process salmon.  Stamping and soldering machines could mass-produce cans from tin plates  Gail Borden invented a means of condensing and preserving milk.  Home iceboxes (1870s innovations in producing ice commercially) allowed for storage of perishable food.  Electrical signs (1890s) made goods more attractive.   The middle class could enjoy products formerly exclusive to the wealthy such as fresh oranges, strawberries, grapes, tomatoes, silk stockings, candy, and cigars.   New convenience goods included Del Monte canned fruits and vegetables, National Biscuit Company (NABISCO) crackers, Van Kamp’s pork and beans, Wesson oil, Lipton tea, Wrigley’s Juicy Fruit chewing gum, Hershey’s chocolate bars, Aunt Jemima pancake mix, Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, Michelob beer.   Economic abundance and consumer goods became associated with the “American way of life.”   Question 4 (continued)  • Cast-iron and steel frame construction techniques developed in 1880s, which allowed for high-rise buildings. The development of skyscrapers and the widespread use of elevators (Otis Elevator Co. installed first electric elevator in 1889) led to multiple-story factories, office buildings, hotels, and apartments. • Technological advancements resulted in the unintended consequence of the rise of leisure time for the middle class and changes in how it was spent; popularity of low-framed safety bicycles (1880s), roller-skating, mass produced pianos, movies; new activities from fairs, carnivals, Coney Island, team sports, especially baseball. • Thomas Edison and his lab at Menlo Park invented electric light bulbs, phonographs, motion pictures, and electric power generators. Nikola Tesla invented the alternating current generator, making electricity more widely available to middle-class consumers. • Household appliances, such as carpet sweepers and suction vacuum cleaners (1869), changed middle-class domestic life. • Development of steel bridges opened up new areas where people could live. • Linotype (1885) created more newspapers, a mass consumption product for urban residents; national press service — telegraphs supplied papers with standardized stories. • 1866, working telegraph cable laid across the Atlantic Ocean. Middle-class urban residents could read about recent international affairs in their newspapers.  • New technology of house construction (balloon frame houses, machine produced nails, water pipes connected to outside water sources, central heat, artificial light) opened new suburban neighborhoods for middle class and were used in urban middle-class residences. • Typewriter (1867), cash register, adding machine, telephone used more in 1890s and prompted more women into office work. • Paved streets with asphalt made vehicular traffic more comfortable and streets safer for pedestrians. • Increase in technology-driven industry resulted in middle-class professions that required more specialized education (engineering, chemistry, metallurgy, architecture). • Margaret Sanger brings diaphragms (developed 1880) to America and develops birth control clinics. Controversial, but makes family planning available to more women. Average family size for middle class continues downward trend.     Question 4 (continued)   Midwestern Farmers • Technology reduced some of the drudgery of farm life.  • Plows made with chilled iron (sod-buster plow 1868) made it easier to plow prairies. • Mechanized tractors, reapers, threshers, harvesters (cord binder 1878), automatic knitters (1880s), spring tooth harrows (1869), seeders, cord binders, corn planters, mowers, listers (1880), grain drills (1874), baling presses (1866), combines, rakers, rotary plows, and manure spreaders increased production while saving back-breaking labor and reducing dependence on work animals. Centrifugal cream separator (1879) made skimming milk easier. Mechanized incubator (1885) increased profits from chicken production. Co-ops allowed farmers to purchase machinery more cheaply and in quantity. • Grain elevators to store and load grain into railroads; these were often controlled by Eastern bankers, which led to financial exploitation. • Steel windmills, dry farming, drought-resistant crops addressed need for water. • The expense of new farm technology, including irrigation systems, meant bank loans. Farmers became dependent on banks and the national market. These conditions favored larger operations that squeezed out small family farms. Such conditions led to Grange and Populist sympathies, bimetalism.  • Farm families tended to invest in labor-saving devices for men’s work, like plowing and harvesting, but not for women’s work like laundry or vacuuming, meaning that technology improved men’s lives more than women’s lives on midwestern farms. • Telephones allowed rural farmers to maintain contact with distant friends and relatives, while the automobile allowed them to connect more with each other and travel to cities. • Telegraph systems also expanded, improving communication for farmers. • New railroad lines gave birth to new towns, allowing farmers to settle along new areas. • Technology professionalized farming and allowed growth of agricultural science; the Morrill Act (1862) gave rise to new colleges that offered agricultural science, such as Cornell University and agricultural and technical colleges; Hatch Act 1887 created state experimental stations for agricultural research. • Technological advancements led to economies of scale; these favored wealthier farmers and average farm size grew; bonanza wheat farms in Minnesota and North Dakota; commercial farms specialized in cash crops; farms dependent on bankers, railroads, and international trade. • Scientific research on agriculture: perfection of hard wheat; Luther Burbank developed new food and seed plants; George Washington Carver created new products at Tuskegee Institute. • Improved rifle and weapons technology allowed the Army to defeat Plains Indians in the Plains Wars, opening up more land for settlement by farmers. • Standardized gauge railroads fostered more integrated rail systems, allowing farmers to more easily transport goods to market. • Refrigerated railroad cars also helped farmers transport goods to market. • Barbed wire (1873-1874, Joseph H. Glidden, I. L. Ellwood) helped the expansion of livestock and farming on Great Plains. • Flour milling process contributed to expansion of wheat farming. • Use of commercial fertilizer expanded in early 20th century. • Pesticide use was more widespread by late 19th century (1910 Insecticide Act regulated sale and use of insecticides); helped to increase production of crops. • Technology changed time: rise of Railroad Standard Time divided the country into four areas: Eastern, Central, Mountain, and Pacific; zones created 1883, federal government made them standard 1918. Question 4 (continued)   • Technological changes broke down the boundaries of local communities and tied them to regional, national, and international markets, cultures, and societies. • Extension of railroads: isolated rural farm families became tied into the national consumer culture with mail order catalogs like Montgomery Ward and Sears, Roebuck & Co. • Irony: technology helped farmers and the agricultural lifestyle, but technology bound them more closely to national, and even international, markets that the individual farmers neither recognized nor controlled; overproduction led to drop in prices and economic distress; the proportion of the number of agricultural workers compared to the larger work force declined. Question 5  Between 1945 and 1975 various groups in the United States engaged in protest.
