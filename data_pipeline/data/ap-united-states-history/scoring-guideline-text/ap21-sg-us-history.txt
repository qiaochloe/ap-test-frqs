Examples that earn this point: Establish a line of reasoning that evaluates the topic of the prompt with analytic categories • “Economic growth during and after World War II changed American society a great deal by encouraging suburban ideals and gender roles. Living the reality of these ideals, however, was more possible for White Americans than for African Americans.” • “Although economic growth changed American society between 1940 and 1970 by bringing more money to more people and providing consumer goods, it did not fundamentally change economic structures.” • “The Second World War helped to bring the United States out of the Great Depression. Continued economic growth through the 1970s resulted in a sense of affluence, particularly as suburbanization accelerated, though this feeling was not shared by all Americans.” Establish a line of reasoning with analytic categories • “Economic growth changed the United States from 1940 to 1970 by bringing more people into the middle class and encouraging suburbanization.” Establish a line of reasoning • “Economic growth changed the United States from 1940 to 1970 by growing the middle class.”  Additional Notes: • The thesis or claim must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion (which may not be limited to the first or last paragraphs). • The thesis or claim must identify a relevant development(s) in the period, although it is not required to encompass the entire period.  Reporting Category  Scoring Criteria  Row B Contextualization (0-1 points)  0 points Does not meet the criteria for one point.  1 point Describes a broader historical context relevant to the prompt.  Decision Rules and Scoring Notes  Responses that do not earn this point: • Provide an overgeneralized statement about the time period referenced in the prompt. • Provide context that is not relevant to the prompt. • Provide a passing phrase or reference.

Responses that earn this point: • Must explain how or why—rather than simply identifying—the document’s point of view, purpose, historical situation, or audience is relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt for each of the three documents sourced. Example of acceptable explanation of the relevance of the author’s point of view: • (Document 7): “The journalist’s use of terms like ‘slice through,’ ‘wipe out,’ and ‘pounded into rubble’ indicates that he believes that federal highway policy was unjust and destructive. As a journalist he may reflect a larger concern about the unequal impact of economic growth in this period. (Provides sourcing regarding the point of view of the document relevant to an argument that addresses race and inequality) Example of acceptable explanation of the relevance of the author’s purpose: • (Document 2): “The purpose of Document 2—restricting property sales by race and ethnicity—demonstrated the larger inequality in postwar economic expansion.” (Provides sourcing regarding the purpose of the document relevant to an argument that addresses the growth of a middle class and/or race and inequality) Example of acceptable explanation of the relevance of the historical situation of a source: • (Document 1): “Because Document 1 emerged from the historical situation of World War II, it reflected the way that military experience and benefits created new opportunities for veterans.” (Provides sourcing regarding the historical situation of the document relevant to an argument that addresses the growth of a middle class) Example of acceptable explanation of the relevance of the audience: • (Document 3): “Because Document 3 was most likely aimed at an audience of female magazine readers, it helped shape gender norms of domesticity in the 1950s.” (Provides sourcing regarding the audience of the document relevant to an argument that addresses gender issues in a period of economic growth)  Examples that do not earn this point: Identify the point of view, purpose, historical situation, and/or audience, but do not explain how or why it is relevant to an argument • “The intended primary audience for Document 3 was most likely female magazine readers.” Summarize the content of the document without explaining the relevance of this to the point of view, purpose, historical situation, and/or audience • “The historical situation with Document 1 is that it explains many of the benefits provided under the G.I. Bill of Rights.”  Row D (continued)  Complexity  0 points Does not meet the criteria for one point.  1 point Demonstrates a complex understanding of the historical development that is the focus of the prompt, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the question.  Decision Rules and Scoring Notes  Responses that earn this point: May demonstrate a complex understanding in a variety of ways, such as: • Explaining nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables. • Explaining both similarity and difference, or explaining both continuity and change, or explaining multiple causes, or explaining both causes and effects. • Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across periods. • Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes. • Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence. Demonstrating complex understanding might include any of the following, if appropriate elaboration is provided: • The response argues that economic growth led to great changes in United States society by encouraging migration. The response corroborates that argument with evidence of multiple migration patterns that included a variety of Americans. Evidence is provided for the migration of middle-class Americans to the suburbs, African Americans to northern cities, and the Sunbelt migration of the 1970s. The response demonstrates that while the motivations and destinations of the migrants differed, each migration was related to the economic growth of the period. • The response argues that sustained economic growth changed United States society through more widespread prosperity and an increase in the standard of living. It then qualifies that argument with evidence about the persistence of poverty. • The response argues that economic growth changed United States society through the growth of the middle-class. It then modifies the argument using evidence about Cold War politics to show that spending on the military and economic recovery abroad, driven by anti-communist ideology, was the origin of post-war economic prosperity and therefore the root cause of societal change.  Additional Notes: • This demonstration of complex understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference.  Document Summaries Document  Summary of Content  Explains the relevance of point of view (POV), purpose, situation, and/or audience by elaborating on examples such as:  1.
