In 1860 three-fourths of 4.1 million foreign-born residents were Irish or German. British • Post 1815, some British relocated to work in New England factories, but numerous others sought to escape the growing urbanization, early phases of industrialization, and economic fluctuations that undercut crafts workers. They were attracted by early efforts to establish British agricultural colonies in America, especially in the Old Northwest. • By the 1830s-40s, some farmers and agricultural laborers began to migrate with their families. Many sold off properties to accumulate capital for buying land and settling in America. However, by the 1850s general prosperity in England reduced the sense of urgency to emigrate. • Americans saw the British as economic assets, in both urban and rural areas, and also associated them with America’s cultural roots. The British were readily accepted by Americans and encountered little hostility. • Some farm “colonies” proved to be too isolated, and many British found they were unprepared for frontier conditions. They either moved into towns or sought already cultivated lands, such as land in Ohio and Indiana. Others eventually scattered quite broadly across America. • Few British established subgroups or ethnic communities as did the Irish and Germans.  The efforts that they did make, including starting newspapers, did not long survive.  However, many British in the United States were eventually regarded as being more democratized than those in England as a result of their American experience. Irish • The Irish are regarded as America’s first refugee population; while some came with resources during the 1830s, by the time of the potato blight in the 1840s it was mostly the poorest and least skilled who were arriving. • Due to limited resources, most Irish remained in port cities—New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, Charleston—and concentrated in urban enclaves.  o Irish were heavily employed on canals, railroads, harbors, and in textile mills. o Many single women (especially domestics) migrated in search of jobs.  o The Irish encountered considerable job discrimination and competition with Free Blacks. o Hostilities led to anti-Irish riots (especially in Philadelphia) and anti-Black riots. • The Irish established churches, parochial schools, mutual aid societies, and other organizations, and sent remittances to bring families to America, but they did not create institutionally complete communities. • Mostly Catholic, the Irish clashed with Americans over public schools, use of the Protestant Bible in schools, and funding for schools. • With the Irish drawn to the Democratic Party in reaction to Whigs’ Protestantism, the Free Soil anti-slavery position, and temperance efforts, nativist Americans such as Samuel Morse sought to delay Irish voting rights (until they were resident for 21 years) and organized the anti-immigrant nativist (Know Nothing) American Party; Millard Fillmore became its candidate for president in 1856. © 2007 The College Board. All rights reserved. • Irish service during the Mexican–American War somewhat improved their standing in  American eyes. German • Germans concentrated on acquiring farm lands from Texas to Wisconsin and the Old Northwest, although many—especially artisans, professionals, merchants—settled in such cities as New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Milwaukee, and Cincinnati. • Initially loyal to German principalities, they were gradually bound together by language and religion. • However, German migrants were quite diverse, comprised of Protestants, Catholics, Jews, and Freethinkers (the ’48ers). • Many agricultural communities were established with nearly all German populations; they were more isolated and had less political influence at first than the Irish. • Germans established schools, churches, synagogues, newspapers, theaters, gymnasiums, militia and fire companies, kindergartens, high schools, and beer gardens—in effect, complete community enclaves, including bilingual schools. • They also opposed the Whigs for the latter’s temperance campaigns and made important cultural contributions with schools, beer halls, and America’s celebration of Christmas. © 2007 The College Board.

All rights reserved. Jane Addams • Addams’ work focused on poverty, low wages, poor conditions and, initially, the need to Americanize immigrants and remove self-destructive customs. • Goal: to address moral decay of urban life, emulating Toynbee Hall in London. She established a settlement house, Hull House, in Chicago in 1889. • Addams aimed to make Hull House a social and civic center and a place to preserve crafts— “immigrant gifts”—as well as a place to educate immigrants about sanitary housing conditions; 400 settlement houses were established across America. • She taught staff to be inspectors, a “sisterhood of reform,” influencing governments and the regulatory movement for slums and factories that opposed child labor and sweatshops and advocated for the 8-hour working day for women. • In the settlement house, Addams established nurseries, penny savings banks, employment bureaus, social clubs, and music, lecture, and reading groups. • Major books: The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets (1909); Twenty Years at Hull House (1910). Andrew Carnegie • In terms of industries, Carnegie did strive to solve the “problems” of the emerging economy with his vertical integration of the steel industry. • Carnegie built wealth around efficient monopolistic operations, vertical integration, lowest possible wages, exploitation of workers, and forbidding unions, along with use of Pinkerton agents during strikes. • He advocated the Gospel of Wealth (1889), laissez faire, and economic survival of the fittest (in an era marked by the virtual absence of government regulations of the economy). • Yet, Carnegie also held that excess wealth was a trust for communities, and he established the Carnegie Corporation, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, the Carnegie Institute of Washington, and, especially, many Carnegie-funded public libraries (ca. 2,500). • Altogether he gave away over $150 million.  Samuel Gompers • Gompers organized craft unions into the American Federation of Labor in 1886; unions were autonomous but cooperated on bread and butter issues necessary for a life of dignity and decency—higher wages, fewer working hours, business liability for injuries, mine safety laws, and leverage of skilled unions; the AFL coordinated strikes and boycotts, except during the First World War, when Gompers opposed unions going out on strike. • He organized unions as corporations negotiating binding “contracts” rather than focusing on government regulations. • The AFL had 2 million members by 1904 but mostly omitted semi- and unskilled workers and women (except the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and United Mine Workers). • Gompers was prejudiced against Black and Asian workers. Upton Sinclair • His book The Jungle (1906) described meatpacking conditions, which spurred Theodore Roosevelt to push for the 1906 Meat Inspection Act that established sanitary rules and inspections; Sinclair’s goal for this work included making the case for socialism as the solution for poor treatment of workers. • Sinclair was an investigative muckraker focusing on abuse of workers and later a socialist candidate for California governor. He established End Poverty in California (EPIC) in the mid-’30s. © 2007 The College Board.

During the war Germans were depicted as brutal, barbarian Huns. • Eventually the United States was portrayed as entering an idealistic war, with the “Fourteen Points” speech and other patriotic addresses by Woodrow Wilson describing the war as a great moral crusade—“the war to end all wars” and make the world safe for democracy • The government relied heavily on the Committee on Public Information (George Creel), which fanned patriotism; organized groups such as the Four Minute Men; promoted Liberty Loans (bond drives) that raised over $20 billion; and supported efforts to discourage organizations from other countries and use of languages other than English, performances of German music, and use of German names and words for foods. • Historic and cultural ties between the United States and Great Britain were emphasized. • The government instituted the draft to make military service fairer (men from all social classes could be drafted). • Campaigns such as One Hundred Percentism, Meatless Mondays, Lightless Tuesdays, and Victory Gardens were emphasized. • Programs to “Americanize” immigrants were begun. • Congress passed the Espionage, Sabotage, and Sedition Acts to suppress dissent; federal agencies and the American Protective League spied on fellow Americans, interned German aliens, and arrested members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). • Patriotism was promoted with patriotic music by composers such as Irving Berlin and George M. Cohan and through movies; the government and Hearst press employed media sensationalism to stir up anti-German feeling, a practice not yet labeled “yellow journalism.” • The government established the War Industries Board, National War Labor Board, Women in Industry Service, the Fuel Administration, the Food Administration, Aircraft Production Board, and U.S. Railroad Administration to stimulate and coordinate the contributions of U.S. businesses to the war effort. • Women were encouraged to take jobs to aid the war effort.  • The government stimulated patriotism among children by encouraging Victory Gardens at schools, scrap drives, bandage rolling, and savings bond drives. • Prohibition of alcohol was approved by Congress in December 1917 as a conservation and anti-German measure, as well a response to the temperance movement. © 2007 The College Board.
