In America, it was in the colonial cities that the transition first occurred from a barter economy to a commercial one. . . . The cities predicted the future. . . . Urban people, at a certain point in the preindustrial era, upset the equilibrium of an older system of social relations and turned the seaport towns into crucibles of revolutionary agitation.” Gary B. Nash, historian, The Urban Crucible, 1986 “The colonist’s attitudes toward civil uprising were part of a broader Anglo-American political tradition. In the course of the eighteenth century, colonists became increasingly interested in the ideas of seventeenth-century English revolutionaries . . . and the later writers who carried on and developed this tradition. . . . By the 1760s . . . this . . . tradition provided a strong unifying element between colonists North and South. It offered, too, a corpus of ideas about public authority and popular political responsibilities that shaped the American revolutionary movement. Spokesmen for this English revolutionary tradition were distinguished in the eighteenth century above all by their outspoken defense of the people’s right to rise up against their rulers.” Pauline Maier, historian, From Resistance to Revolution, 1991 Using the excerpts above, answer (a), (b), and (c). a) Briefly describe ONE major difference between Nash’s and Maier’s historical interpretations of the origins of the American Revolution. b) Briefly explain how ONE specific historical event or development from the period 1754–1800 that is not explicitly mentioned in the excerpts could be used to support Nash’s argument. c) Briefly explain how ONE specific historical event or development from the period 1754–1800 that is not explicitly mentioned in the excerpts could be used to support Maier’s argument. Scoring Guide 0–3 points Score 3 Response accomplishes all three tasks set by the question. Score 2 Response accomplishes two of the tasks set by the question. Score 1 Response accomplishes one of the tasks set by the question. Score 0 Response accomplishes none of the tasks set by the question. Score NR No response.

Given the timed nature of the exam, responses may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. • Clarity: Exam responses should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. Note: Students may refer to intellectual developments, cultural trends, or events that precede the time period specified in the question (i.e., the Great Awakening, Lockean political philosophy, Whig political traditions, Bacon’s Rebellion). Students should be credited for responses where the context of the reference makes clear that they are referring to the continued aftereffects or reverberations of these events or ideas into the period specified by the question. Note: The same example can be used to respond to more than one section of the prompt, but the response needs to provide specific and explicit explanations for how the example provides evidence to answer each section. Note: Merely mentioning an event will not result in the awarding of points in parts (b) and (c). Responses must specifically explain how the events represent evidence that can support the author’s claim. Examples of responses to (a) that would earn credit: • Nash argues that: o The social changes that contributed to the American Revolution emerged from coastal seaports in British North America, particularly out of the commercial and free-market activity generated in these seaports. o New social and commercial relations made it more likely that colonists would revolt against Great Britain to create a more democratic social and political order. Short Answer Question 1 (continued) • While Maier argues that: o Older Anglo-American (trans-Atlantic) political ideas and writings that the colonists shared with Great Britain, dating back to the 17th century, were the root of revolutionary traditions and thought in the colonies. o Ideas crossing the Atlantic, going back to the 1600s, helped bind together the northern and southern colonies and were the primary shapers behind the American revolutionary movement. Credited responses must explicitly address the substance of both excerpts. Examples of responses to (b) that would earn credit: • Many protests occurred against taxation and commercial laws such as the Townshend Duties, the Tea Act, and the Coercive (Intolerable) Acts in colonial cities. • Mechanics, artisans, laborers, and seaport day laborers in colonial seaports (including women) formed the core of the grassroots revolutionary protest. • Growing class formations in the seaport towns (i.e., free laborers, workers, financiers, merchants) fostered conflict and protest by upending traditional social relations. • Some people called for the abolition of slavery during the American Revolution in New England colonies with fewer slaves. • Sections of the United States with fewer slaves (New England) had greater participation in the Revolution. • The Great Awakening started in New England towns and coastal seaports and quickly spread inland and southward, thereby encouraging the emergence of new ideas about individual liberty and freedom and anti-authoritarianism that became more commonplace by the start of the Seven Years’ War. • Printed material by Thomas Paine and other Enlightenment thinkers circulated more quickly in coastal cities. • Laborers and artisans participated in the independence movement. • Coastal trade centers benefited greatly from mercantilism during the first half of the 18th century — the so-called period of salutary neglect; however, the Navigation Acts became more problematic in and around those centers as the British government imposed taxes to raise revenue after 1763. Examples of responses to (c) that would earn credit: • A renewed interest in republicanism and republican ideals spread across the Atlantic. • Whig political ideas and writings, such as those of John Locke and other Enlightenment thinkers, spread across the Atlantic where they influenced many in the colonial elite. • The Articles of Confederation represented many political ideas that had originated across the Atlantic. • The first president and the author of the Declaration of Independence were both from the Virginia elite. • Colonists in the later 18th century shared Anglo-American revolutionary traditions originating in the English Civil War. • The First Great Awakening encouraged the emergence of new ideas about individual liberty and freedom and anti-authoritarianism. • Religious ideas and writings of the First Great Awakening, such as those of George Whitefield, spread across the Atlantic where they influenced many. Short Answer Question 1 (continued) • There were traditions of revolt amongst colonists and enslaved people operating outside the bounds of coastal seaports (e.g., the Paxton Boys, Regulators, slave rebellions, Shays’ Rebellion, Puritans, Pilgrims, Bacon’s Rebellion, etc.). • Printed materials by Thomas Paine and other English writers circulated widely throughout the colonies and greatly influenced colonial thought. • The actions of the First Continental Congress reflected the continuation of English revolutionary traditions by representatives from throughout the colonies, not merely seaports. • The signing of the Declaration of Independence represented the acceptance of Enlightenment and English revolutionary thought by a wide range of representatives from throughout the colonies. Short Answer Question 2 A Nauseating Job, But It Must Be Done Saturday Globe © Bettmann/Corbis The Progressive Era image above depicts President Theodore Roosevelt.

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. Examples of responses to (a) that would earn credit: NOTE: Responses must specifically explain how the perspective expressed by the artist is related to the role of government and may not merely describe the content of the cartoon. • Public expectations changed concerning the role of government in regulating health and safety issues, especially the meat industry; many people thought the government should extend or enlarge its role in protecting the health and welfare of citizens. • Government, particularly the president and Congress, should take a more active, if sometimes reluctant, role in regulating the economy. • President and Congress resisted being goaded into reform, as demonstrated by Theodore Roosevelt’s hesitant, nose-holding stance and his walking out on the plank over the vat of rotten meat and “scandal.” • Theodore Roosevelt’s response to these and other reform issues was an important turning point concerning the role of presidential power. • A perceptive response might note that the artist has a certain degree of skepticism of the role of muckraking journalists (an attitude shared by the subject of the illustration, Theodore Roosevelt). Examples of responses to (b) that would earn credit: NOTE: The response must explain an event or development that is a cause of the situation depicted in the image. • The rise of Progressive Era health, safety, and workplace concerns. • Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle exemplified muckraking related to this issue. Short Answer Question 2 (continued) • The tradition of laissez-faire government and weak or no regulation of food or business. • Industrialization of agriculture and the meat industry. • Muckrakers such as Ida Tarbell, McClure’s Magazine exposed problems to the public. • General muckraking journalism attacked businesses for putting profit before the public interest. Examples of responses to (c) that would earn credit: NOTE: The response must provide a new concept or an elaboration of a concept addressed earlier, not just a repetition or inversion of (a) or (b). • The passage of Meat Inspection Act, 1906 and Pure Food and Drug Act, 1906 (FDA). • The rise of specific Progressive Era health, safety, and workplace reforms. • The government took a more proactive, if still reluctant, role in protecting consumers. • The regulatory role of the government became more legitimate, undercutting the doctrine of laissez faire. • Roosevelt used the Sherman Anti-Trust Act to dismantle “bad trusts.” • Roosevelt advocated for his Square Deal and the three Cs (control of corporations, consumer protection, and conservation of natural resources). • Trust-busting continued into Taft and Wilson administrations. • The enactment of state and federal child labor laws in response to the issues depicted in the image. • Woodrow Wilson Administration efforts to regulate economy and business (e.g., Clayton Anti-Trust Act, creation of the Federal Reserve, creation of the income tax). Short Answer Question 3 Answer (a), (b), and (c). Confine your response to the period 1500 to 1750. a) Briefly describe ONE specific historical difference between the role of religion in Spanish colonization and in the colonization of New England. b) Briefly describe ONE specific historical similarity between the role of religion in Spanish colonization and in the colonization of New England. c) Briefly explain ONE specific historical effect of religion on the development of society in either the Spanish colonies or the New England colonies. Scoring Guide 0–3 points Score 3 Response accomplishes all three tasks set by the question. Score 2 Response accomplishes two of the tasks set by the question. Score 1 Response accomplishes one of the tasks set by the question. Score 0 Response accomplishes none of the tasks set by the question. Score NR No response.

NOTE: To identify Catholicism and Christianity as different is not an acceptable response. • New England colonists were more likely than Spanish colonists to establish settlements as religious enclaves. • New England colonists were more likely than Spanish colonists to have settled in the Americas in order to obtain greater religious autonomy from the state. • Religion was one of many motivations for Spanish colonists (or a primary motivation for a minority), whereas it was a primary motivation for many 17th-century New England colonists. • Spanish colonists often treated colonization as a means of proselytizing native peoples while many New England colonists sought to create separate religious communities. • New England colonists made religion more central to government and civic engagement than did the Spanish. • The Spanish engaged in more extensive proselytizing among native peoples than did New England colonists. • The English used force to acquire land, while the Spanish used force to require religious conversion among Native Americans. • Spanish missions were larger and more common than conversion efforts such as New England praying towns. • The Spanish colonists were a majority religious group in their home countries, while the New England colonists were a minority religious group in their home country. Examples of responses to (b) that would earn credit: • Both groups of colonizers sought to proselytize Christianity (Catholicism and Puritanism) and convert Native Americans in the New World. • Both groups made religion part of civic life/community development. • Native Americans in both the Southwest and New England used religion to help maintain their own culture in the face of colonization. • Religious issues influenced the political sphere and government for both. • Both used religion to justify exploitive labor systems. • Both used religion and/or ideas of religious superiority to justify land acquisition and the displacement and domination of native people. • Both were not tolerant of other religions in their colonies and often persecuted members of other religious groups. Examples of responses to (c) that would earn credit: NOTE: Examples must be confined to the period from 1500 to 1750 to earn credit. • Spanish: o Encomienda system o Missions o Large-scale conversion to Catholicism o Pueblo Revolt o Conflicts between church and state Short Answer Question 3 (continued) OR • New England: o Puritan influence on government (e.g., Mayflower Compact, Fundamental Orders of Connecticut) o Local democracy in town meetings o Half-Way Covenant o Praying towns o Salem witch trials o Great Awakening o Puritan dissenters and the creation of new colonies in Connecticut and Rhode Island (Anne Hutchison, Roger Williams, Thomas Hooker) o Development of religious educational institutions (Harvard) o “City Upon a Hill” as an example of religious “greatness” Short Answer Question 4 Answer (a), (b), and (c). a) Briefly describe ONE specific historical difference between the internal migration patterns within the United States in the period 1910–1940 and the internal migration patterns in the period 1941–1980. b) Briefly describe ONE specific historical similarity between the internal migration patterns in the period 1910–1940 and the internal migration patterns in the period 1941–1980. c) Briefly explain ONE specific historical impact of the internal migration patterns in either period. Scoring Guide 0–3 points Score 3 Response accomplishes all three tasks set by the question. Score 2 Response accomplishes two of the tasks set by the question. Score 1 Response accomplishes one of the tasks set by the question. Score 0 Response accomplishes none of the tasks set by the question. Score NR No response.

(1 point) To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt rather than restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion.  The thesis must make a historically defensible claim that establishes a line of reasoning about causes of the expanding role of the United States in the world in the period from 1865 to 1910. Examples that earn this point include: • “This change in foreign policy was caused by the need for new markets to expand [the] US economy and by imperialist sentiment. However, the most important cause of this change in the US’s role can be attributed to nationalist and Darwinist sentiment because it was driven emotionally, and therefore was a stronger motive.”  • “In expanding its role in the world, the United States sought economic opportunity through international business relationships, political opportunity to police the world, and they sought to cultivate other societies to better spread the American culture.”  B: Contextualization(0–1)  Describes a broader historical context relevant to the prompt.

Given the timed nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. • Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 point) Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion. Examples of acceptable theses: • “While some historians may argue that the US desire to expand its role in the world was due to the fact that the US felt it was its duty to civilize nations and act as a global police, the most important reason for America expanding its role in the world can be attributed to its competition with Europe over global influence, its desire to expand its economy through trading opportunities, and the U.S. ideal of manifest destiny.” (This example suggests a historically defensible line of argument development.) • “The country was doing this for a few reasons, such as expanding its territory, (manifest destiny or imperialism) preserving its national interests such as trading with China, and helping other nations.” (This example establishes the analytic categories for the argument.) Examples of unacceptable theses: • “Due to this, America began to embark on an imperialistic mission in the latter half of the 1800’s in the name of economic, social, and political ‘necessities’.” (This example is too generic and not specific to the time period.) • “Different causes and events had a major importance in expanding the role of the US in the world.” (This example largely restates the prompt.) B. Contextualization (0–1 point) Responses earn 1 point by describing a broader historical context relevant to the topic of the prompt. To earn this point, the response must accurately and explicitly connect the context of the prompt to broader Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) historical events, developments, or processes that occurred before, during, or continued after the time frame of the question. This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference. To earn the point, the response must accurately describe a context relevant to the expanding role of the United States in the world in the period from 1865 to 1910. Examples of context might include: • The impact of the Civil War on the United States role in the world • International competition to establish colonies and maintain empires from 1865 to 1910 • Increasing United States industrialization and desire to develop new markets for goods • The closing of the frontier in 1890 Example of acceptable contextualization: • “In the aftermath of the war, internationally the world was changing, Europe was slicing up Africa, many countries started fighting for their independence, and the fight for influence and money ensued between the most powerful nations. During the time periods of 1865–1900, the US sought to keep up with Europe and expand its sphere of influence in the world under the leadership of Roosevelt, McKinley and other presidents.” (This example describes one broader historical context relevant to the topic of the prompt.) Example of unacceptable contextualization: • “Throughout all of American history, the debate over whether or not to create alliances with foreign countries continues to be prominent. Documents such as Washington’s Farewell Address or the Monroe Doctrine warned against these alliances. However, towards the end of the 1800’s, America began to engage in foreign countries through alliances or attempting to imperialize other nations.” (This example does not earn credit for contextualization because it is historically inaccurate in asserting that the Monroe Doctrine warned against alliances, and it is not a trend or development that influenced imperialism of the late 19th century.) C. Evidence (0–3 points) Evidence from the Documents In order to earn 1 point for using evidence from the documents, the response must address the topic of the prompt by using at least three documents. To earn 1 point for evidence from the documents, the response must accurately describe — rather than simply quote or paraphrase — content from at least three of the documents to address the topic of the prompt. Example of describing the content of a document: • “Doc. 6 depicts Uncle Sam, its purpose showing the US having control over the country, trying to seem generous, when it actually isn’t.” (This example describes evidence from the documents relevant to the topic, so it contributes toward the first evidence point, but it does not use that evidence to support an argument about the cause of the expanding role of the United States in the world, so it does not contribute toward the second point.) Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Example of unacceptably describing the content of a document: • “Document 6 is the effect of document 2, where the whites try to get other people to share the wonders of Christianity, albeit in a slightly conventional way.” (This example does not contribute toward describing evidence from the documents relevant to the topic because it misinterprets the document and is confused in its assertion.) OR Document Content — Supporting an Argument Responses earn 2 points by using the content of at least six documents to support an argument that responds to the prompt. (2 points) To earn 2 points, responses must accurately describe the document’s content; they cannot earn a point by merely quoting or paraphrasing the documents with no connection to the topic of the prompt. Example of supporting an argument using the content of a document: • “However, social causes were also a factor in the practice of American Imperialism. There was seen through the application of Social Darwinism to a global scale. Many felt that Anglo-Saxon, were a more fit race than any to expand, and Christianize and civilize the rest of the world (Doc. 2).” (This example connects Strong’s inferred Social Darwinism to the cause of the United States expansionism.) Example of unacceptably supporting an argument using the content of a document: • “Document 2 really demonstrates the effect of religious superiority, and the pride in racial heritage.” (This example describes evidence from the documents relevant to the topic, so it contributes toward the first evidence point, but it does not use that evidence to support an argument about the cause of the expanding role of the United States in the world, so it does not contribute toward the second point.) Evidence Beyond the Documents In order to earn 1 point for evidence beyond the documents, the response must use at least one additional piece of specific historical evidence (beyond that found in the documents) relevant to an argument that addresses the topic. To earn this point, the evidence must be described and must be more than a phrase or reference. This additional piece of evidence must be different from the evidence used to earn the point for contextualization. Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as supporting evidence beyond the documents will typically be more specific details that function as support for a particular point made in an argument, analogous to the function of evidence drawn from the documents. Evidence used might include the following, with appropriate elaboration: • Anti-Imperialist League; Peace Movement • Algeciras Conference, 1906 • Berlin Conference, 1884–1885 • Burlingame Treaty, 1868 • Chinese Exclusion Act • Gentleman’s Agreement Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) • Root-Takahira Agreement, 1908 • Dollar diplomacy • Annexation of Guam • Platt Amendment/ Teller Amendment • Annexation of Hawaii • Insular cases • Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine • Mexican Revolution • Manifest Destiny • USS Maine; The Maine • Missionary work • Social Darwinism • Panama (Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty, 1903) • Panama Canal • Russo-Japanese War; United States mediation (Treaty of Portsmouth, 1905) • Spanish-American War • Filipino Insurrection, Emilio Aguinaldo • Venezuela Crisis • “White Man’s Burden” • William Seward (Seward’s Folly, Seward’s Icebox) • Yellow Journalism (William Randolph Hearst, Joseph Pulitzer) • Theodore Roosevelt’s foreign policy; Big Stick diplomacy, jingoism • Treaty of Paris, 1899 Example of acceptable use of an additional piece of specific historical evidence: • “Newspapers had risen in popularity among the public, a majority who could read, and many companies competed to attract the public’s attention. Yellow journalism created outrageous attitudes with dramatized accounts of Spanish mistreatment of the Cuban.” (This example uses a particular piece of evidence beyond the documents to make a connection to a larger argument.) Example of unacceptable use of an additional piece of specific historical evidence: • “The result of Josiah’s saying was Manifest Destiny. This westward expansion would create new states and territories, importantly also creating the Missouri Compromise.” (This example would not earn credit for evidence beyond the documents because it is historically inaccurate and not connected to the question concerning late 19th-century American imperialism) D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points) Document Sourcing For at least three documents, the response explains how or why the document’s point of view, purpose, historical situation, and/or audience is relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt. To earn this point, the response must explain how or why — rather than simply identifying — the document’s point of view, purpose, historical situation, or audience is relevant to an argument addressing the prompt for each of the three documents sourced. Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Example of an acceptable explanation of the relevance of the document’s point of view: • “The point of view of the artist is actually critical of America’s policy of imperialism, seeing it as a sign of America’s ego in its superiority and greed.” (This example contributes toward a point for document sourcing because it correctly identifies the point of view of the cartoon as satirical of United States imperialism.) Example of an unacceptable explanation of the relevance of the document’s point of view: • “The document (4) shows the pride many Americans felt at living in a country that controlled such vast amounts of territory.” (This example does not contribute toward a point for document sourcing because it falsely states that the cartoon illustrates a United States point of view that is positive concerning overseas expansionism when the cartoon portrays the opposite.) Example of an acceptable explanation of the relevance of the document’s purpose: • “Puck, being a satire magazine, likely published this cartoon with the purpose of showing the hypocritical nature of the Spanish-American War; it was fought to liberate Cuba but it ended with the oppression of the Philippines.” (This example contributes toward a point for document sourcing because it links the purpose of the cartoon to the effect of expansionism for the Filipinos.) Example of an unacceptable explanation of the relevance of the document’s purpose: • “The purpose of this document was to tell America why Russia was ceding its territory and giving permission.” (This example does not contribute toward a point for document sourcing because it presents the content of the document and does not explain its purpose.) Example of an acceptable explanation of the relevance of the historical situation of a document: • “The cartoon is best understood in the context of the Spanish American War. The Spanish gave up its claims to Cuba and the Philippines, leaving the territory open for the US to take advantage of.” (This example contributes toward a point for document sourcing because it situates the document in reference to the Spanish-American War and the increased possibilities that became open to the United States abroad.) • Example of an unacceptable explanation of the relevance of the historical situation of a document: “According to the Puck cartoon (Document 6), the United States sent missionaries to the Philippines.” (This example does not contribute toward a point for document sourcing because it does not connect United States missionary activity to the expansion of its role in the world.) Example of an acceptable explanation of the relevance of the audience: • “This highlights that Strong was appealing to a White audience likely to support imperialism for the maintenance of racial hierarchy.” (This example contributes toward a point for document sourcing because it connects the audience for Strong’s book to support the reason behind imperialism.) Example of an unacceptable explanation of the relevance of the audience: • “In document 1, the audience is the United States government.” (This example does not contribute toward a point for document sourcing because it does not connect the stated audience to the relevant argument concerning causes of imperialism.) Demonstrating Complex Understanding The response demonstrates a complex understanding, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the question. Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Demonstrating a complex understanding for this prompt might include: • Explaining a nuance by exploring different ways (e.g., via trade, via annexation) in which the role of the United States in the world expanded • Explaining similarities and differences in the United States role in different parts of the world • Explaining connections to other time periods, such as efforts to establish United States international standing in the late 18th and early 19th centuries • Confirming the validity of the response’s argument by explaining how different documents corroborate the argument in spite of differing perspectives among the authors • Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering evidence that shows the limits of the United States role in the world at this time • Exploring the effects of imperialism on indigenous peoples above and beyond inferences from documents This understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference. Example of demonstrating complex understanding: • The response qualifies its argument throughout by interweaving historically insightful nuances that richly qualify the argument. The following example illustrates this sophisticated historical analysis: “The US took many efforts to try to assimilate the Filipinos to make them have the same political and societal views as they did. This reflects the ongoing trend of that time of racial superiority which is synonymous to how the US treated newly freed slaves at home. However, despite the imposing negative shadow the US cast over conquered lands due to nationalism, this feeling came from a sense of morality and genuine care for other people.” Example of unacceptably demonstrating complex understanding: • This essay fails to deeply qualify the argument for it is too general and nondescript throughout. The following example illustrates this simplistic approach: “This time period was difficult to go through, but when other nations realized that they needed the United States, it gave them what they all wanted and needed. Over time, the United States’ role expanded to helping others by trading, protecting and claiming their territories for the better of their lives.” Question 2 — Long Essay Question Evaluate the extent to which commercial exchange systems such as mercantilism fostered change in the British North American economy in the period from 1660 to 1775. Maximum Possible Points: 6 Points  Rubric  Notes  A: Thesis/Claim (0–1)  Thesis/Claim: Responds to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis/claim that establishes a line of reasoning (1 point) To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt rather than restating or rephrasing the prompt.

This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or a reference.  To earn the point, the response must accurately describe a context relevant to the ways in which commercial exchange systems such as mercantilism fostered change in the British North American economy. Examples of context might include the following, with appropriate elaboration. • The development of joint-stock companies • The growth of British imperial power • Increasing trans-Atlantic and worldwide economic connections and trade • Increased British role in international slave trade • European competition in the New World • Extended discussion of mercantilism  © 2018 The College Board.

OR Complexity: Demonstrates a complex understanding of the historical development that is the focus of the prompt, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the question (2 points) To earn the second point, the response must demonstrate a complex understanding.

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 points) Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion. Examples of acceptable theses: • “Commercial exchange systems such as mercantilism fostered change in the British North American economy from 1660 until the beginning of the Revolutionary War by pushing the colonies away from a simple, bartering lifestyle that is dependent on British goods to a complex, commercialized economy that was self-sufficient.” (The response suggests an evaluative line of argument development.) • “Commercial exchange systems such as mercantilism fostered a great deal of change in the British North American economy because it meant an increase in the shipping industry, a single yet ready market for the colonies, and an increase in the use of slavery in the colonies.” (The response establishes the analytic categories for the argument.) Examples of unacceptable theses: • “The switch to mercantilism created a bad economy for the colonies but not Britain.” (This mentions the economic situation in the colonies but does not suggest a line of reasoning about how commercial exchange systems such as mercantilism contributed to that claim). • “The British North American economy fostered change to a great extent due to commercial exchange systems such as mercantilism.” (This example largely restates the prompt.) © 2018 The College Board. Visit the College Board on the Web: www.collegeboard.org. Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) B. Contextualization (0–1 points) Responses earn 1 point by describing a broader historical context relevant to the topic of the prompt. To earn this point, the response must accurately and explicitly connect the context of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that occurred before, during, or continued after the time frame of the question. This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference. To earn the point the response must accurately describe a context relevant to the ways in which commercial exchange systems such as mercantilism fostered change in the British North American economy. Examples might include the following, with appropriate elaboration: • The development of joint-stock companies • The growth of British imperial power • Increasing trans-Atlantic and worldwide economic connections and trade • Increased British role in the international slave trade • Reduction in Puritan rules and beliefs • Commercial revolution of 18th century • Seven Years’ War between Britain and France • Increased intercolonial trade Example of acceptable contextualization: • “As soon as the first settlers landed in the New World it was an opportunity for economic gain. The Spanish had the intention of finding gold in Mezoamerica. The French also had the intention of making money in the north through the all-important fur trade. Many English settlers came to the New World in search of economic gain, mostly the wealthy.” (The response earned 1 point for contextualization because it has a short but accurate description of the economic motivations of three empires in the age of mercantilism.) Example of unacceptable contextualization: • “Under the system of mercantilism, a colony, such as America, is only able to buy and sell resources and products from its mother country, Britain. (The response did not earn the point for contextualization because it does not fully explain a broader historical situation relevant to the prompt. Instead it provides only a straightforward definition for the term “mercantilism.”) C. Evidence (0–2 points) Evidence Responses earn 1 point by providing at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt. Responses can earn this point without earning the point for a thesis statement. © 2018 The College Board. Visit the College Board on the Web: www.collegeboard.org. Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) These examples of evidence must be different from the information used to earn the point for contextualization. Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence will typically be more specific information. Examples of evidence used might include: • Navigation Acts of 1660, 1663, 1673, and 1696 • Staple Act (1673) • Woolen Act (1699) • Hat Act (1732) • Molasses Act (1733) • Iron Act (1750) • Currency Act (1751) • Smuggling/piracy • Stamp Act (1765) • Seven Years’ War (French and Indian War), 1754–1763 • Sugar Act (1764) • Townshend Acts (1767–8) • Tea Act (1773)/Boston Tea Party • Intolerable Acts (1774) • Colonial boycotts of British goods • Committees of correspondence/Sons of Liberty/Daughters of Liberty Example of acceptably providing evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt: • The end of salutary neglect would lead to “the establishment of acts like the Tea and Stamp Act. These acts hindered the colonist’s economy as they were forced to be taxed on everyday goods. This appalled Americans as they were restricted of also their trade with other nations due to Britain.” (The response earned 1 point for evidence. The response correctly identifies legislation and its impact on the colonial economy. The evidence is not used to advance an argument about changes in the British North American economy, so it did not earn the second point.) Example of unacceptably providing evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt: “The invention of the cotton gin increased revenue and allowed mercantilism to enter into the trade between the colonies and Great Britain.” (The response incorrectly identifies the cotton gin as having relevance to the era of mercantilism. Not enough specific and relevant information was provided to earn the point.) OR Supports an Argument Responses earn 2 points if they support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant examples of evidence. © 2018 The College Board. Visit the College Board on the Web: www.collegeboard.org. Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) Example of acceptable use of evidence to support an argument: • “For example, the Molasses Act put a tariff on foreign goods that limited the ability of colonists to buy cheaper goods, while measures such as the Woolen Act prevented them from manufacturing within the colonies because English manufacturers depended on their markets.” (The response correctly identifies two specific pieces of relevant information, which are then used to develop the larger argument that mercantilism prioritized the colonial production of raw goods.) Example of unacceptable use of evidence to support an argument: • “Then as events such as the French and Indian War destroyed the British economy, it looked to the colonies. . . . This marked the overturning of the economy as the colonies were now seen as a source of income.” (The response earned 1 point for providing examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt. The response did not earn a second evidence point because the example is not used to fully develop an argument about economic change.) D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points) Historical Reasoning Responses earn 1 point by using historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument that addresses the prompt. To earn this point the response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument, although the reasoning might be uneven or imbalanced. Examples of using historical reasoning might include: • Explaining how the growth of trade and mercantilist exchange fostered the increased availability of consumer goods in 18th-century British American colonies • Explaining how American efforts to avoid mercantilist restrictions helped foster the growth of smuggling and informal trade networks Example of acceptable use of historical reasoning: • “Commercial exchange systems led to a change from the headright system to an increased use of slavery. . . . In addition, the Navigation Acts led to increased economic dependence of the colonies upon Britain.” (The response earned 1 point because it identifies the ways in which commercial exchange systems affected the British North American economy and its role in mercantilism; however, this is not developed in a complex fashion to earn the additional analysis point.) Example of unacceptable use of historical reasoning: • “British North American colonies focused on planting food crops to support themselves and their economy. However, the soil was terrible, so they turned to other methods.” (This did not earn the first point for historical reasoning because the argument is too vague and the language does not indicate change, continuity, comparison, or causation.) © 2018 The College Board. Visit the College Board on the Web: www.collegeboard.org. Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) OR Complexity Responses earn 2 points for demonstrating a complex understanding of the topic, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify that argument. Demonstrating complex understanding might include: • Explaining a nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables, such as examining how mercantilism and British salutary neglect of the colonies existed simultaneously • Explaining both continuity and change, such as the continued agricultural nature of the economy even as trade expanded and became more important • Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across periods, such as connecting economic development in the colonial period with that during the market revolution and industrialization in the 19th century • Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes • Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence, such as arguing that mercantilism had both positive and detrimental effects on the American economy This understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference. Example of acceptable demonstration of a complex understanding: • The response earned the point for complexity as the argument makes relevant and insightful connections by building from the economic freedom of the early colonial period to later colonies in “defiance of English rule.” The response notes that “England paid very little attention to its colonies due to its own inner turmoil.” The response then expands on this by discussing the “loosely-enforced Navigation Acts” which allowed the colonies “to expand and prosper independently.” It then connects this to the end of salutary neglect and the French and Indian War. Finally, the response builds toward the act that “taxed colonists and that put some restraint on their economic independence . . . and infringed on colonial independence in other ways.” Example of unacceptable demonstration of a complex understanding: • This response earned 1 point for historical reasoning because it presents a straightforward change over time argument about the colonies becoming an increasing source of wealth for Great Britain. It does not earn the complexity point, however, because it does not demonstrate a nuance, explain continuity as well as change, explain relevant connections across periods, or achieve the other criteria for complexity. “To this end, Britain encouraged production of cash crops such as sugar and tobacco, as well as raw materials such as lumber and iron and agricultural products. Britain also discouraged domestic industries in the colonies, preferring that colonists purchase British goods.” © 2018 The College Board.

(1 point) To earn the first point, the response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument, although the reasoning might be uneven or imbalanced. OR Complexity: Demonstrates a complex understanding of the historical development that is the focus of the prompt, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the question. (2 points) To earn the second point, the response must demonstrate a complex understanding. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways, such as: • Explaining a nuance of an issue by  Examples of using historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument might include: • Explaining how innovations that began during the Civil War, such as the abolition of slavery or a standardized system of currency, contributed to economic changes over time • Explanations of how some broader elements of the economy, such as regional divisions between a more agricultural South and more industrial North or the growing role of big business and particular industries such as railroads, demonstrated continuity over time in spite of the Civil War OR Demonstrating a complex understanding might include: • Explaining a nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables, such as effects of transportation changes on westward expansion and imperialism and their ties to the economy • Explaining both continuity and change, such as continuities in the United States economy in addition to changes • Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across periods by linking the economic impact of  analyzing multiple variables • Explaining both similarity and difference, or explaining both continuity and change, or explaining multiple causes, or explaining both causes and effects • Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across periods • Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes  the Civil War with the economic impact of other wars • Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives, such as considering the place of poor white Southerners in the economy in addition to African Americans and plantation owners  © 2018 The College Board.

Given the timed nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. • Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 point) Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion. Examples of acceptable theses: • “The Civil War fostered economic change in the fact that the Southern labor force was forever changed, but it fostered less economic change, due to the North’s and South’s role in the economy staying the same.” (The response suggests a line of reasoning with both change and continuity.) • “Due to the Civil War from 1861, America’s economy massively changed due to Industrialization, the creation of railroads, and the stopping of slavery in entirety.” (The response establishes the analytic categories for the argument.) Examples of unacceptable theses: • “After the war, much damage was done to the South, including their major cities and plantations. Their economy struggled greatly during and in the years after the war.” (The example is primarily descriptive and provides no basis for an analytical claim.) • “The Civil War totally flipped the US economy upside-down from 1961-1900. At the end of wartime, the US has some strengths and weaknesses that it had to address. The economy was rejuvenated and new. While also being archaic and unable to keep up with current laws.” (This attempts to suggest a line of reasoning about how the Civil War changed the economy but is too vague.) © 2018 The College Board.

Contextualization (0–1 point) Responses earn 1 point by describing a broader historical context relevant to the topic of the prompt. To earn this point the response must accurately and explicitly connect the context of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that occurred before, during, or continued after the time frame of the question. This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference. To earn this point, the response must accurately describe a context relevant to the ways in which the Civil War fostered change in the United States economy in the period from 1861 to 1900. Examples might include the following, with appropriate elaboration: • Small producers before the war • Industrial expansion, particularly in the North • Southern reliance on cotton production • Government support for economic development • Adoption of standardized parts and industrial manufacturing • Corporate consolidation and monopolies • Boom and bust business cycle Example of acceptable contextualization: • “Throughout the first half of America’s 19th century, the country was going through the market revolution. The nation was developing a national economy as internal improvements sprung up, connecting the country with canals and roads. Amidst this economic change however, sectional tensions between the North and South developed and grew.” (This example describes one broader historical context relevant to the topic of the prompt.) Example of unacceptable contextualization: • “Factories continue even beyond 1900 for the same purpose, which is making materials necessary in war & civilian life. . . . Factories provided a huge shift and boom for American wealth to both workers although not as much as the employers who make a lot of money which helped sti[m]ulate the American economy and made it prosperous for a good while until the depression.” (This example in itself would not earn credit for contextualization because occasional references to the 20th century are vague and not clearly relevant to the prompt.) C. Evidence (0–2 points) Evidence Responses earn 1 point by providing at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt. Responses can earn this point without earning the point for a thesis statement. These examples of evidence must be different from the information used to earn the point for contextualization. Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence will typically be more specific information. © 2018 The College Board.

Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie made trusts out of oil and steel, respectively.” (This example cites evidence relevant to the topic, so it earned the first evidence point, but it does not use that evidence to support an argument about changes in the United States economy, so it did not earn the second point.) Example of unacceptably providing evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt: • “After being freed, many Africans Americans in the South traveled North in the Great Migration.” (This response did not earn credit for evidence because the term is outside of the time period.) OR Supports an Argument Responses earn 2 points if they support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant examples of evidence. Example of acceptable use of evidence to support an argument: • “The Southern half of the US stayed rooted in its agricultural traditions following the Civil War. The agricultural economy had relied on slave labor which was no longer available, Southern farmers turned to slavery-like practices such as sharecropping to keep African Americans bound to work for very little pay.” (This example connects a specific piece of evidence — the development of sharecropping — to ways in which the South remained largely agricultural despite changes from the Civil War.) Example of unacceptable use of evidence to support an argument: • “In addition to African Americans, immigrants from Asia, Poland, Ireland, and many other countries traveled to the North.” (This example cites evidence relevant to the topic, so it would count for the first evidence point, but it does not use that evidence to support an argument about changes in the United States economy due to the Civil War or another relevant argument, so it did not earn the second point.) D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points) Historical Reasoning Responses earn 1 point by using historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument that addresses the prompt. To earn this point, the response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument, although the reasoning might be uneven or imbalanced. © 2018 The College Board. Visit the College Board on the Web: www.collegeboard.org. Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) Examples of using historical reasoning might include: • Explaining how innovations that began during the Civil War, such as the abolition of slavery or a standardized system of currency, contributed to economic changes over time • Explanations of how some broader elements of the economy, such as regional divisions between a more agricultural South and more industrial North or the growing role of big business and particular industries such as railroads, demonstrated continuity over time in spite of the Civil War Example of acceptable use of historical reasoning: • “The Civil War boosted industry in the North and destroyed agriculture in the South. The Northern economy thrived due to an increase in industry production for Union troops and extended trade with other countries such as Egypt. The Southern Economy was left in ruins due to need for confederate soldiers, trade blockade by the North, destruction of land, and the abolition of slavery.” (This example earned the point for historical reasoning because it compares/contrasts the war-caused economic growth in the North with war-caused economic devastation in the South.) Example of unacceptable use of historical reasoning: • “The Civil War also fostered another Great change in the economy, but in a negative way in the South.” (This sentence did not earn the point for historical reasoning because the attempt at a comparison is only stated on one side and undeveloped due to “change” and “negative” being too vague.) OR Complexity Responses earn 2 points for demonstrating a complex understanding of the topic, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify that argument. Demonstrating complex understanding might include: • Explaining a nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables, such as effects of transportation changes on westward expansion and imperialism and their ties to the economy • Explaining both continuity and change, such as continuities in the United States economy in addition to changes • Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across periods by linking the economic impact of the Civil War with the economic impact of other wars • Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes, such as considering the place of poor white Southerners in the economy in addition to African Americans and plantation owners • Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence, such as arguing that the South experienced economic devastation during the war but then recovered after the war through renewed industrialization in certain areas, renewed cotton cultivation through systems such as sharecropping, and establishment of new systems of labor control • Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence, such as arguing that the Southern economy did not change much as a result of the Civil War This understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference. © 2018 The College Board. Visit the College Board on the Web: www.collegeboard.org. Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) Example of acceptable demonstration of a complex understanding: • The following thesis sets up a more complex and nuanced approach to the prompt than typically seen. The response continues to develop this line of argument throughout the essay, arguing that the “economy & industry of the Northern states” saw “minimal” shift, the transition from slavery to sharecropping was “purely nominal” and railroad expansion during the war “acted as a catalyst for acceleration, not change” that was “inadvertent.” This framework allows for discussion of continuity and change as well as comparison of the North to the South. This response earned both points for analysis. “The economic situation of the country, while being accelerated on its original course, was not changed in any drastic fashion. The North remained an Industrial & Manufacturing economy. The South remained an agrarian economy (with sharecroppers instead of slaves), and the railroads built during the Civil War to facilitate troop movements only solidified the Northern Economic dominance prevalent before the war.” Example of unacceptable demonstration of a complex understanding: • The following response provides a framework for analysis through discussion of transportation improvements, agriculture, and big business. However, it does not expand its analysis to generate a more complex argument. Therefore, this response earned the first point but did not receive the second point for analysis and reasoning. “The construction of the railway opened many new markets through the easier transportation of goods. . . . The 13th amendment freeing slaves saw the South changing it’s farming policy to sharecropping. . . . The government took a hands-off approach to the economy.” © 2018 The College Board.

(1 point) To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt rather than restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion.  The thesis must make a historically defensible claim that establishes a line of reasoning about how scientific or technological innovation changed the United States economy from 1950 to 2000. Examples that earn this point include: • “Scientific and technological innovations changed the United States economy in the period 1950–2000. Due to those innovations a mass consumption culture emerged as well as a shift to service based industries.” • “From 1950 to 2000 scientific and technological  advances and innovations heavily impacted the United States economy. The two major factors that played into this were the cold war and mass consumerism and production.”  B: Contextualization(0–1)  Contextualization: Describes a broader historical context relevant to the prompt.

This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or a reference.  To earn this point, the response must accurately describe a context relevant to the ways in which scientific or technological innovation changed the United States economy in the period from 1950 to 2000. Examples of context might include the following, with appropriate elaboration. • World War II and the Cold War • The emergence of corporate research and development departments as sources of scientific and technological innovation • Federal government investment in science and  technology • Baby Boom/mass consumption. • Automation and deindustrialization/transition to a service economy.  © 2018 The College Board.

When soldiers returned from the war, they started families that led to the “Baby boom”.   . . . Cookie-cutter houses helped to show mainstream culture in the economy.” (This response cites evidence relevant to the topic, as the term “cookie-cutter houses” is a reference to Levittowns, so it earned the first evidence point, but it does not use that evidence to support a historically defensible argument about changes in the United States economy so it did not earn the second point. While responses tend to use the baby boom as historical context, this response employs it as evidence.) Example of unacceptably providing evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt: • “One example would be the space race with the USSR as NASA was created and discovered the moon in 1960.” (This response did not earn a point for evidence because it is historically inaccurate.) OR Supports an Argument Responses earn 2 points if they support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant examples of evidence. Example of acceptable use of evidence to support an argument: • “We adapted our education and expanded NASA’s budget, creating a growing market for Rocket Scientists and specialized engineers. This bolstered the US economy. Suddenly more people were attending college and getting higher paying jobs.” (This response connects research and development with changes in the United States economy.) © 2018 The College Board.

The whole economy was made into producing nukes for the Cold War. Also during this time, the U.S. and Russia were having a space station race to see who would be the first to launch a satellite (Spondnik-first Russian satellite).” (This response cites evidence relevant to the topic, so it earned the first evidence point, but it does not connect that evidence to an argument about changes in the United States economy, so it did not earn the second point for supporting an argument. In addition, the response includes historical inaccuracies that detract from the attempt to develop an argument.) D.

To earn this point, the response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument, although the reasoning might be uneven or imbalanced. Examples of using historical reasoning might include: • Explaining how the development and evolution of particular technological innovations (such as computers or the Internet) contributed to economic changes over time • Explanations of how some broader elements of the economy (such as capitalism or basic financial structures) demonstrated continuity over time in spite of scientific or technological changes Example of acceptable use of historical reasoning: • “Eisenhower warned of the military industrial complex which Reagan amplified. When President Kennedy died, Johnson replaced him and brought in the “Great Society.” This wasn’t able to function due to the money going toward the Cold War.” (This response earns the point for historical reasoning because it indicates changes fostered by the technological advancements of the military-industrial complex. The response indicates economic consequences for social programs caused by rising Cold War tensions.) Example of unacceptable use of historical reasoning: • “Technological innovations brought America to faster and more efficient ways to transport.” (This sentence did not earn the point for historical reasoning because the language does not effectively explain change, continuity, comparison, or causation in regard to the United States economy.) OR Complexity Responses earn 2 points for demonstrating a complex understanding of the topic, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify that argument. Demonstrating complex understanding might include: • Explaining a nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables, such as the interactions of multiple technologies that fostered economic change © 2018 The College Board.

The response provides rich context for economic changes in the latter portion of the 20th century, pointing out that “crises for oil had led to an increase in inflation, coupled with a stagnant economy under Jimmy Carter.” The response set the stage for a nuanced discussion of supply-side economics as stimulus. “The industrial revolution created many low wage job for unskilled workers. On the other hand, this rise in technological innovation created a desire for innovators and people with ideas and knowledge who had higher education. This change in technology would continue to change our economy after 2000. The rise of e-commerce is a perfect example of this. Companies like Amazon would begin to sell goods over the internet in much higher quantities. This has created a type of second wave consumerism.” Example of unacceptable demonstration of a complex understanding: • This response did not earn the complexity point. Although the response attempts to explain an aspect of communication technology, it is not specific and asserts a link to decreasing unemployment without providing evidence to support the assertion. “Communication fostered economic growth in many aspects of American society. Advancements in mass media allowed corporations to grow and decreased the unemployment rate.” © 2018 The College Board. Visit the College Board on the Web: www.collegeboard.org.
