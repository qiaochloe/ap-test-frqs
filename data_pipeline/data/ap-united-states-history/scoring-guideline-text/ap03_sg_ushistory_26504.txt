WAYS IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT UNDER THE ARTICLES WAS EFFECTIVE IN SOLVING PROBLEMS CONFRONTING THE NEW NATION (Although the Articles were not technically ratified until 1781, one can assume that answers from 1777 onward should be considered acceptable. Although the question does not use the words “government under the Articles,” we presume that is implicit because the document itself, the Articles, did not solve many problems and that would pose a very limiting question.) Facts More Commonly Found in Student Papers: • Recognized the desire of the states for limited central government  • Got most states to surrender claims to lands west of the Appalachians by 1781 that would become the source of revenues and future states • Despite weaknesses, the central government did keep the Confederation together until it was replaced and did keep the nation out of war • Government attempted to deal with the problem of foreign and domestic debts • Land Ordinance of 1785 provided for the sale of public lands in the West; provisions included surveying land, and providing for public education • NW Ordinance of 1787 established territorial procedures for the admission of the five states as equal and prohibited slavery in that territory • Waged the Revolutionary War • Negotiated the Treaty of Paris ending the war with Great Britain • Authorized the meeting of the Constitutional Convention in 1787 and put the proposed document before the states for ratification (even though provision for ratification by 9 states violated Article 13 – the requirement for unanimous approval of any changes.) Facts Less Commonly Found in Student Papers: • Negotiated mutual defense treaty with France • Debt was $41.2 million, including a foreign debt of $7.9 million • The government succeeded in reducing much of the domestic debt to about 6 million although increasing the international debt to 10.2 million • Established a bureaucracy that continued after 1789 and was incorporated into the new government under the Constitution, namely Departments of War, Finance, and Foreign Affairs, and the Post Office • Land Ordinance 1785 provided for the sale of public lands in the West at $1/acre with a 640-acre minimum; about $760,000 would be received during the Confederation Period. Provisions included surveying land along the lines used in establishing New England Towns (square mile sections divided into 640 acre sections, with a section set aside for schools.) • Negotiated commercial treaties with France, Sweden, Holland, Prussia, and Morocco and borrowed money from Holland Copyright © 2003 by College Entrance Examination Board.

Result was huge balance of trade deficit, deflation and depression during the 1785-87 period • Unable to get passage of navigation laws to limit ships from nations not having commercial treaties with the U.S., Great Britain in particular • No resolution with England regarding debts owed between Americans and the English, the treatment of Loyalists, the economic losses due to the more than 50,000 slaves who left with the British, and British provocations along the borders and their encouragement of Indian attacks there; western territories and southern states were vulnerable, especially Georgia • No provision for admitting new states other than Canada and other existing British colonies • Failed to halt the abuses of paper money, particularly by Georgia, North Carolina, New Jersey, and especially Rhode Island; New York, South Carolina, and Pennsylvania handled theirs satisfactorily • Unable to foster any real sense of nationalism, although a nationalist group does eventually emerge that engineered the calling of the Constitutional Convention Copyright © 2003 by College Entrance Examination Board.
