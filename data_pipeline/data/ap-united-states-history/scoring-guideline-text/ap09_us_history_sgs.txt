Illiteracy was one of several differences between North and South that antislavery people pointed to as evidence of the backward, repressive, and evil nature of a slave society in a free-enterprise capitalist democracy.  Political Forces (Republicans formed in 1854 in response to the Kansas–Nebraska Act; opposed to the expansion of slavery; combined remnants of Whig, Free Soil, and Know-Nothing parties as well as disgruntled Democrats.)  • Manifest Destiny (Polk’s 1844 platform) • “Gag rule” • Liberty Party (1840) • Free Soil Party/Martin Van Buren/James Birney • “Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men” • Mexican–American War (Mr. Polk’s War)  - Lincoln Spot Resolution - Treaty of Guadalupe Hildago - Wilmot Proviso (defeated in the Senate) - Popular Sovereignty/Lewis Cass • Compromise of 1850 (Clay, Calhoun, Webster) - Fugitive Slave Law - California (free) ended the balance in the Senate between free and slave states. - Popular sovereignty in Utah and New Mexico territories - Ended slave trade in D.C. • Personal liberty laws • Underground Railroad • Gadsden Purchase (1853) • Kansas–Nebraska Act (1854—Stephen Douglas) - Many northern Democrats despised Douglas’s compromise. - “Bleeding Kansas” (sacking of Lawrence) - John Brown/Pottawatomie massacre - Border ruffians - Lecompton and Topeka Constitutions - Brooks-Sumner Affair/“The Crime against Kansas” Question 3 Fact Sheet (continued)  • By 1854 northern Whigs could no longer claim a national party; divided by Kansas–Nebraska Act (Conscience Whigs; Cotton Whigs) • Filibustering in Cuba and Nicaragua (1854 Ostend Manifesto) • “Young America” movement • “Know-Nothings” (American Party)     - Connected to the temperance movement  - “Slavery, rum, and Romanism”  - Republican argument that the “slave-power conspiracy” was a greater threat to American liberty          and equality than an alleged “popish plot” proved to be persuasive. Nativists did not have to           abandon their ethnic and religious prejudices to become Republicans.

The candidate, General Winfield Scott, alienated many southern Whigs, and the party was so split it could not field a candidate in 1856.  Democratic Party—Remained a national party through 1856, but Buchanan’s actions as president made southern domination of the party so clear that many northern Democrats were alienated. Stephen Douglas, running as a Northern Democrat in 1860, won 29 percent of the popular vote; John Breckinridge, running as a Southern Democrat, won 18 percent.  Liberty Party—Antislavery party ran James G. Birney for president in 1844. He won 62,000 votes, largely from northern antislavery Whigs.  Free-Soil Party—Ran Martin Van Buren, former Democratic president, in 1848. Gained 10 percent of the popular vote, largely from Whigs but also from some northern Democrats.  American (Know-Nothing) Party—Nativist party made striking gains in 1854 congressional elections, attracting both northern and southern Whigs. In 1856 its presidential candidate, Millard Fillmore, won 21 percent of the popular vote.  Republican Party—Founded in 1854. Attracted many northern Whigs and northern Democrats. Presidential candidate John C. Fremont won 33 percent of the popular vote in 1856; in 1860 Abraham Lincoln won 40 percent and was elected in a four-way race.                          Question 3 Fact Sheet (continued)  Economic Forces (Republican economic ideology: favored free labor, slavery degraded labor, northern economy ensured freedom, independence for white working men, southern society was backward/stagnant, belief in self-made man, faith in social mobility, economic rights for ALL men   Republican economic platform: internal improvements (railroad construction), high tariffs, Homestead Act, end to internal slave trade, immigration restrictions.)  • Market Revolution  - Southern dependence on “King Cotton”  - Northern manufacturing and internal improvements  - Immigration; urbanization • Economic dislocation (depression of 1839–1843; Panic of 1857) • California Gold Rush (1849) • Most of the railroad construction bound the western and eastern states and reinforced the effect of slavery in creating a distinct “North” and “South.” • Debate over transcontinental railroad (Gadsden Purchase; Kansas–Nebraska Act) • Northern and western merchants and manufacturers drifted to the Republican Party because it promised to use a strong national government to promote commerce and internal improvements.  Northern and western farmers liked the Republican Party’s commitment to cheap land (Homestead Act). • Planters, in the minds of many northerners, also deliberately shunned entrepreneurship and hard work, which were qualities valued by Americans who embraced free labor and industrialization.  Abraham Lincoln, an early member of the Republican Party, championed northern values of social mobility and a strong work ethic. • Free soil would serve as a guarantee of free competition or the “right to rise.” But if slavery was permitted to expand, the rights of “free labor” would be denied. Some Republicans also pandered to racial prejudice: they presented their policy as a way to keep African Americans out of the territories, thus preserving the new lands for exclusive white occupancy.  - Northern business hostility toward antislavery movement, seeing it as a threat to profitable trade          with the South • Walker Tariff, 1846: low tariff measure that delighted the South but angered the North    Question 4  Choose TWO of the following organizations and explain their strategies for advancing the interests of workers.

Lawlor, 1908 (Danbury Hatters’ Case): federal court ruled that secondary boycotts were conspiracies in restraint of trade and therefore illegal under Sherman Antitrust Act.  • Clayton Antitrust Act (1914) stated that labor organizations were not combinations in restraint of trade; Gompers called the act the Magna Carta of labor; in reality, the act did little to further the cause of unions. • Ludlow Massacre, 1914: UMW strike against Colorado coal mines, September 1913–April 1914; governor ordered Colorado National Guard into area and then removed most of them; coal companies hired private mine guards; confrontation between strikers and private guards/state guards resulted in troops burning strikers’ tent city, killing 14 (among them 11 children); miners attacked southern Colorado mines; Woodrow Wilson sent in U.S. Army. • First World War helped AFL; AFL supported the war; Gompers appointed to National War Labor Board (NWLB) 1918; NWLB supported many AFL goals, including eight-hour days and right to organize; Gompers and AFL promised not to strike or ask for union shops (although some locals did strike). • 1919, AFL started massive campaign to organize steel workers. • 1919 strikes:   - Involved over four million workers in 3,600 strikes.  - Federal troops broke strikes (i.e., Seattle shipyards and then a general strike).  - Steel strikes, 1919–1920 against U.S. Steel failed; at first AFL endorsed steel strikes, but then     did not. • Antiunion campaign in early 1920s:  - Employers associated unions with communism and disloyalty.  - Used yellow-dog contracts. - “The American plan” backed by National Association of Manufacturers, Chamber of Commerce;  pushed open shop.  - Company unions (U.S. Steel, International Harvester). - “Welfare capitalism” used by businesses to defuse unions (International Harvester, Ford, General Electric, Bethlehem Steel); provided benefit plans, recreational facilities, sometimes profit-sharing.  - Total union membership dropped to 3.5 million in 1926. • U.S. government very antiunion in early 1920s: - Duplex Printing Press Co v. Deering, 1921: Supreme Court upheld illegality of secondary boycott; supported right of courts to issue injunctions against strikers. - Colorado Coal Company v. United Mine Workers, 1922: Supreme Court ruled that a striking union could be prosecuted for illegal restraint of trade. Question 4 Fact Sheet (continued)  - 1922: Justice Department helped to stop a strike by 400,000 railroad workers and a nationwide strike by 650,000 miners. - 1924: courts refused to protect members of UMW against coal mine owners in western Pennsylvania. • William Green, AFL president in 1924: wanted cooperation with business; opposed to communism and socialism; discouraged the use of strikes.  Socialist Party of America (SPA) Background: • Founded 1901 (merger of Social Democratic Party of America and members of Socialist Labor Party). • Leaders: Eugene V.

The question requires students to “analyze.” Analysis can be seen in a number of ways, including: • Placing the home-front experiences of the two groups in a historical context, including any changes to experiences and impact of experiences • Discussing group’s responses to their home-front experiences • Discussing the experiences as being positive or negative • Comparing and/or contrasting group experiences 2. Only the FIRST two groups addressed by the student can be scored—NO EXTRA CREDIT for a third group. 3. Students may make generalizations about racism and discrimination or mention only general events. Remember there must be a connection between the home-front experiences of each group and the Second World War (e.g., zoot suits = being unpatriotic; more minority job opportunities stem from defense industries). 4. Do not be swayed by a seemingly good thesis; many 1’s and 2’s have a thesis due to the short length of the question. 5. Most students selected African Americans as one of their groups. Japanese Americans were most frequently the second group, followed by Mexican Americans. Few students chose Jewish Americans, and those who did often did not include much information beyond the Holocaust. Some did allude to the emotional experience of Jewish Americans to the Holocaust or the tension over Zionism in the Jewish community. 6. Home-front experiences outside the time period and military experiences may be included but should not be exclusive, and they must be relevant. 7. Numbers and percentages used can be approximate as long as they are reasonable.           Question 5 Fact Sheet  African American Home-Front Experiences: • General discrimination in housing and employment; continuation of Jim Crow segregation. • Great Migration: - Several million moved from rural areas to cities. - Over one million found defense jobs in North and on West Coast.  • Housing shortages/overcrowding and white resentment kept African Americans in urban ghettos - 1942: Mob in Detroit burned a cross on grounds of Sojourner Truth Homes (federally funded apartments); move into the apartments later supervised by state police. • Over a million African American men joined the armed forces; this represented 10 percent of the troops made up by 11 percent of the population.  - Fairer treatment than in First World War:  Allowed in air corps (over 600 pilots) and marines.  More responsibility in army and navy.  Benjamin Davis—first black general commissioned in the army.  Dorie Miller—Pearl Harbor hero’s picture used in recruitment poster. - Continued segregation in the military:  Tuskegee Airmen/Black Eagles (3,000 pilots) continued to be discriminated against; Eleanor Roosevelt flew with and supported the airmen.  Navy confined Black and Hispanic sailors to menial noncombat tasks; example of Port Chicago, California, where 320 sailors working as stevedores died from an ammunition explosion; 50 court-martialed for refusing to return to the docks.  Inferior facilities in and around army camps, especially in the South. • Before U.S. entry in the war, A.
