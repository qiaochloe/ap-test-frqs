(Domino theory) • It could be compared to Kennedys response (Doc I) and to the problems that later developed with Castro in Cuba. • This could remind students that Dulles was also the supporter of brinkmanship & massive retaliation. • It may suggest connections to the Monroe Doctrine. • Students could discuss the difficulties the Eisenhower administration had in working with Latin American nations to get this resolution passed and the undercurrent of anti-U.S. hostility at the conference. • Students might continue to discuss the actions the Eisenhower administration took in Guatemala  CIA, support for the United Fruit Company. Copyright © 2001 by College Entrance Examination Board.

All rights reserved.  Advanced Placement Program and AP are registered trademarks of the College Entrance Examination Board. 4 Inferences: • This suggests John Foster Dulles program of Massive Retaliation. • It also suggests increasing fears due to the development of missiles; missile gap debate. • Students might note that this represents a magazines agenda and not necessarily that of the government. • The Soviet development of missiles creates a need for new government policies (such as development of antiballistic missiles, first strike capabilities, arms reduction.) • The impact of Sputnik could also be described (and ties made to Documents F and G). DOCUMENT F Source: Herblock, the Washington Post, January 1958  Document Information: • The cartoon shows one man (Eisenhower) saying to another Well, I Got That In, All Right as they leave the budget building. • It shows a missile (labeled Missile Programs) jammed into the budget building. • Cars labeled Civilian Services,  Limited War Capabilities, Space Development, School Construction, and Welfare Programs are falling off the cliff below the house. Inferences: • This suggests that the focus on missile programs is at the expense of most other social and scientific programs. • The cliff suggests a tie to brinkmanship. • It can be tied to Document E to show the increasing concerns over the missile race. • It can be contrasted with Document G which seems to show increasing expenditures on education. • It can also be tied to Document H showing the increasing amounts of money spent on defense. • The impact of Sputnik could also be discussed (and ties made to Documents E and G). DOCUMENT G: Source: Special Message to the Congress from President Eisenhower on Education, January 1958 Document Information: • Eisenhower argues that the Federal government must play an emergency role in improving the educational system due to national security interests. • He argues that young people must be prepared to contribute the maximum to the countrys future progress. • Eisenhower argues the country must pay special attention to science and engineering education because of the importance of science and technology. Inferences: • This document suggests the impact that Sputnik had on American education. • It ties to the developing space race. • This is the National Defense Education Act. • This is a landmark education act providing direct federal assistance to public schools. • It also strengthened graduate education and the teaching of math and foreign languages. • The Advanced Placement Program was spawned by the same fears! Copyright © 2001 by College Entrance Examination Board.

Kennedy, inaugural address, January 1961  Document Information: • Kennedy warns other nations that we will pay any price, bear any burden to make liberty succeed. • He asks both sides to try to create peace so that the forces unleashed by science do not destroy humanity in a planned or accidental catastrophe. • He also says that we must negotiate from a position of strength  • However, he warns that both sides are burdened by the cost of modern weapons, both are alarmed by the power of the deadly atom. • Kennedy also warns that both  sides are racing to change that uncertain balance of terror that prevents mankinds final war.. Inferences: • The first part of the speech suggests that Kennedy will continue Cold War strategies despite the defense spending of the 1950s: Cold War Warrior. • The final paragraph suggests peaceful coexistence. Copyright © 2001 by College Entrance Examination Board.
