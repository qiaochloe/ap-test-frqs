He sought to avoid the extremes both of socialism and pure laissez-faire individualism, but he became more committed to Progressive reform during his second term.  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND LABOR Prior to TR • Not much support of labor by the federal government. • Broke strikes with troops (railroad strikes, 1877; Pullman strike, 1894). • Use of injunctions against labor unions for violating Sherman Anti-Trust Act (Pullman strike, 1894). During Presidency of TR (1901-09) • Anthracite coal strike, 1902 o TR wanted compromise between miners and mine owners. o Considered using the army to take over and reopen mines. o Convinced mine owners to accept arbitration by the federal government (Anthracite Coal Strike Commission), but TR did not recognize the miners’ union (United Mine Workers). • Square Deal for labor, business, and the public. • Department of Commerce and Labor, 1903 (created Bureau of Corporations). • Lochner v. New York (1905): struck down 10-hour workday for bakers. • 1907: TR proposed eight-hour day for workers and broader compensation for industrial accidents. • Muller v. Oregon (1908): upheld maximum working hours for females. © 2007 The College Board. All rights reserved. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND TRUSTS Prior to TR • Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad (1886): corporations are treated as “persons” under the law and get the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment.  • Interstate Commerce Act (1887). • Sherman Antitrust Act (1890). • United States v. E. C. Knight (1895): protected manufacturers from antitrust law. • William McKinley: very probusiness, but in 1898, was appointed to the U.S. Industrial Commission on Trusts, which did look into the issue of trusts and industrial combinations (among other issues). During Presidency of TR (1901-09) TR and Trust Busting • Congress did not want to pass regulatory legislation when TR took office. o TR accepted the idea of business centralization and believed government should regulate big business rather than eliminate it; “good trusts” vs. “bad trusts”; historians have argued that TR was not as much of a trust buster as he is often portrayed to be. o TR used trust busting selectively: some informal “understandings” (“gentlemen’s agreements”) between corporations and the federal government, for example, U.S. Steel got TR’s consent before it took over Tennessee Coal and Iron Company in 1907. o During his second term, TR turned more toward regulation of business rather than trust busting. • Justice Department went after Northern Securities Company in 1902; Northern Securities v. United States (1904). Supreme Court ruled Northern Securities violated the Sherman Act. • Swift and Company v. United States (1905) (“beef trust” case): Supreme Court ruled that meatpackers had avoided competitive bidding when purchasing livestock and as a result had violated the Sherman Antitrust Act; “stream-of-commerce” doctrine; livestock and meat products were part of interstate commerce and subject to federal regulation. • Standard Oil and American Tobacco cases began (Supreme Court ruled to break up Standard Oil and reorganize American Tobacco in 1911). • Under TR, the Justice Department filed cases under the Sherman Act (but most came to trial after he left office). • Expedition Act (1903): hastened prosecution of antitrust suits. • Department of Commerce and Labor (1903): created Bureau of Corporations, which could investigate activities of interstate corporations, but many corporations cooperated with the bureau to alleviate the need for antitrust lawsuits by federal government. Examples of Regulation of Business Not Directly Related to Trusts • Pure Food and Drug Act (1906). • Meat Inspection Act (1906). • Elkins Act (1903): no rebates by railroads. • Hepburn Act (1906): ICC established maximum freight rates. © 2007 The College Board. All rights reserved. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND CONSERVATION Prior to TR • Federal government often debated with western states about water rights but did not consider the impact of water policies on the environment. • Desert Land Act (1877): federal government sold arid land on the condition it be irrigated. • Division of Forestry created by Congress in 1881 (part of the Department of the Interior). • Forest Reserves Act (1891): president had power to establish forest reserves to protect watersheds.
