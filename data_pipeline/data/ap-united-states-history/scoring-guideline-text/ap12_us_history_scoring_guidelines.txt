He collects tithes by reducing wages as remorselessly as the Shah of Persia or the Sultan of Turkey, and, like them, is not amenable to any human power. He can discharge (banish) any employee without cause. … He can withhold their lawful wages. He can delay trial on a suit at law, and postpone judgment indefinitely. He can control legislative bodies, dictate legislation, subsidize the press, and corrupt the moral sense of the community. He can fix the price of freights, and thus command the food and fuel-supplies of the nation. In his right hand he holds the government; in his left hand, the people. Document Information • Railroad presidents are similar to kings. • Railroad presidents can discharge workers without cause and withhold wages. • Railroad presidents can delay lawsuits. • Railroad presidents control both the government and the people. • Railroad presidents controlled freight prices and monopolized food and fuel industries. • Railroad presidents corrupt communities and control the press. Document Inferences • The financial clout of railroads leaves employees helpless. • Railroad labor and farm unrest is likely. • Railroads dictate government policy. • The Senate is controlled by wealthy interests because senators are not popularly elected. • The legal system favors railroad interests.  Potential Outside Information  blacklisting  Munn v.

In short, the people who work in the modern factory are, as a rule, taught to do one thing—to perform one and generally a simple operation; and when there is no more of that kind of work to do, they are in a measure helpless. The result has been that the individualism or independence of the producer in manufacturing has been in a great degree destroyed, and with it has also in a great degree been destroyed the pride which the workman formerly took in his work—that fertility of resource which formerly was a special characteristic of American workmen, and that element of skill that comes from long and varied practice and reflection and responsibility. Document Information • Workers no longer work independently but as if they were part of a military organization. • Workers are taught to perform one simple task. • Manufacturing has largely taken away workers’ pride in their work. Document Inferences • Mass production techniques led to specialization of labor. • Specialization of labor decreases workers’ pride in their craft. • Specialization of labor leaves workers largely unskilled. • Unskilled labor is relatively easy to replace. Potential Outside Information specialization of labor sweatshops unskilled/skilled labor Document Information • Shows trusts as oversized. • Shows public entrance to the Senate closed. • Shows monopolists lined up at monopolists’ entrance. • Shows some senators looking back toward the trusts. • Shows sign saying “This is a Senate of the monopolists by the monopolists and for the monopolists.” Document Inferences • The Senate (government) is controlled by big business. • People have no control over the Senate because senators are not directly elected. • Monopolists (trusts) are wealthy and powerful. • Trusts control a great many industries. Potential Outside Information Billion Dollar Congress Bland-Allison Act Civil Service (Pendleton) Act Crime of ’73 Dingley Tariff direct election of senators (Populist platform, not Seventeenth Amendment) © 2012 The College Board.

Simmons, The Birth of a Nation, Edward Clarke, Elizabeth Tyler. o Hiram Wesley Evans became imperial wizard in 1922. o Advocated “100 percent Americanism.” o Championed white supremacy (slogan: “Native, White, Protestant Supremacy”). o Became a force in Democratic Party politics, particularly in Midwest and small-town United States. o Practiced systematic terror against blacks, Jews, Catholics, foreigners. o Faded after D. C. Stephenson affair, Indiana, 1925. o Lothrop Stoddard, in The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy, 1924, warned against “weakening” of white race through immigration and “mongrelization”; believed in “race types.” • Anti-Catholicism and anti-Semitism were popular. • Many small-town and rural Americans feared urbanization. Outcomes • Ku Klux Klan expanded in the 1920s. • Challenges arose to race-thinking and nativism: cultural pluralism (Horace Kallen’s term in 1924); anthropologists argued that no scientific evidence existed for racial theories or hierarchical order of societies from “primitive” to “civilized” (Franz Boas, Ruth Benedict). • Some immigrants championed the idea of ethnic Americans; B’nai B’rith and National Catholic Welfare Council lobbied against discrimination against immigrants by employers, colleges, or government. • Trial of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, 1921, and execution, 1927, showed fear and association of immigrants with political radicalism. • California’s 1920 Alien Land Act prohibited land rentals by aliens ineligible for citizenship or by corporations with stock held by aliens ineligible for citizenship. • Immigration Act (Emergency Quota Act) of 1921 included the following: o Established overall maximum of 357,000 immigrants per year. o Established quotas based on national origins: 3 percent of each country’s nationals residing in United States in 1910. • Married Women’s Act (Cable Act) of 1922 said that “any woman citizen who married an alien ineligible for citizenship shall cease to be a citizen of the United States”; women could not acquire citizenship by virtue of spouse’s status but instead had to apply on their own.  • Ozawa v. United States (1922) decided that Japanese immigrants were inassimilable aliens and racially ineligible for United States citizenship; Supreme Court ruled that the definition of race was not a scientific one but was based on the “understanding of the common man”; therefore “white persons,” the phrase in the law, meant northern and western Europeans. • In Myer v. Nebraska (1923), the Supreme Court struck down state laws prohibiting teaching in a language other than English. • In United States v. Thind (1923), the Supreme Court ruled that Asian Indian immigrants were inassimilable aliens and racially ineligible for United States citizenship. • Johnson-Reed Immigration Act (National Origins Act) of 1924 established National Origins Plan to begin 1929: o Cut maximum to 164,000 and reduced European quotas to 2 percent of nationality in United States in 1890, thereby discriminating against southern and eastern Europeans. o Excluded “aliens ineligible for citizenship” (East and South Asia, Japan; Chinese already excluded by law 1882, 1892). o Filipinos, Mexicans, Canadians (Western Hemisphere) exempted.  o Prevented Asian women from joining their husbands in United States. o Allowed foreign-born wives and children of United States citizens to enter as nonquota immigrants. o Divided balance of world into so-called five colored races (black, mulatto, Chinese, Japanese, Indian). o Created a new category: “illegal alien.” • In Hidemitsu v. United States (1925), Supreme Court forbade naturalization of Japanese (to maintain distinction of race and color in naturalization laws). • Hispanic immigration included the following: o Legal arrivals from Mexico peaked at 89,000 in 1924, after which the Mexican government restricted emigration to United States. o Illegal immigration increased because of southwestern agricultural productions and the demand for “stoop labor.” o Hispanics were the fastest growing minority in the United States, especially from Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Cuba. o Mexican communities grew in San Antonio, Denver, El Paso, and Los Angeles; smaller communities existed in Chicago, Detroit, Kansas City, and Gary; Spanish Harlem in New York City; barrios. o Formation of mutual aid societies (mutalistas), which became centers of resistance to civil rights violations and discrimination.  o Federation of Mexican Workers Unions was formed in 1928. o League of United Latin American Citizens was formed in 1929 by middle-class Mexican professionals. • United States Border Patrol was established in 1925; made border crossing from Mexico more difficult (head taxes, visa fees, literacy tests, document checks). • National Origins Act was revised in 1927; established new quotas to begin in 1929: o Set annual limit of 150,000; completely excluded Japanese immigrants. o European quotas were decided in proportion to “national origins” (country of birth or descent) of continental United States inhabitants in 1920. o Immigrants from Western Hemisphere (except potential paupers as defined by Labor Department) were excluded from quotas. • In Buck v. Bell (1927), Supreme Court upheld Virginia’s law requiring compulsory sterilization of so-called unfit people, including people who were mentally retarded, “for the protection and health of the state”; more states began to pass compulsory sterilization laws; sterilization was used as a method of dealing with the immigrant population. • Mexicans were subjected to discrimination in employment and residence patterns: o Often confined to barrios; legal restrictions in some states on employment, such as teaching, legal profession, public works projects. o Agribusiness interests tried to keep borders open, using racial stereotyping as their weapon (only Mexicans could perform physically demanding work “owing to their crouching and bending habits”). • Anti-Filipino riots in California took place in 1929, resulting in 1934 legislation to eliminate immigration from the Philippines. Prohibition Origins • Prior to 1920 the following took place: o Temperance movement (Women’s Christian Temperance Union) arose. o Some Progressives supported prohibition; temperance was partly an expression of the belief that immigrants’ use of liquor had to be disciplined. o Anti-Saloon League (1893, 1895), supported by Methodist and Baptist clergy, worked for prohibition; challenged by brewing associations in battleground states (e.g., Texas) to get “wet” voters to polls. o Jubilee Convention, 1913, of the Anti-Saloon League endorsed constitutional amendment. o Webb-Kenyon Act of 1913 outlawed shipment of alcohol into dry states; vetoed by Taft, overridden by Congress. o In 1914 Anti-Saloon League began push for constitutional amendment and advocated making states liquor free. o In 1916 election two-thirds majorities in both houses of Congress were prohibitionists. o By 1917 three of four Americans lived in dry counties; by 1920, 26 states had prohibition laws; almost two-thirds of states adopted laws forbidding manufacture and sale of alcohol.  o First World War saw no use of grain for liquor; brewing industry was connected to German immigrants. o Eighteenth Amendment was passed by Congress in December 1917, was ratified in 1919, and took effect in January 1920: prohibited manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages; supported by every state except Connecticut and Rhode Island (large Catholic populations). o Volstead Act of 1919 (passed over Wilson’s veto) said “no person shall manufacture, sell, barter, transport, import, export, deliver, or furnish any intoxicating liquor except as authorized by this act.” Did not prohibit the use of intoxicating liquors. Defined intoxicating liquor as any beverage containing more than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume. Established federal Prohibition Bureau for enforcement.  • Prohibition as the “noble experiment” involved the following: o Arguments against drinking: family decline; liquor interests corrupted state legislatures and helped political machines (bosses worked in conjunction with saloons, brothels, and gambling clubs and exploited “ignorant”); eroded workforce and business/labor efficiency; declining morals and religious values; poverty, crime, unemployment, bad labor conditions, unrestrained sexuality. o Arguments for Prohibition: moral reform to regenerate society. o Ku Klux Klan supported Prohibition. o Wets vs. Drys; small-town and rural Americans’ fear of urbanization, “wet” culture, and immigrant culture. Outcomes • Fewer arrests were made for drunkenness; deaths from alcoholism declined. • As problems associated with drinking declined, its urgency as a social issue receded. • Drinking was still pervasive in United States society (lawbreaking, speakeasies, increased drinking among women and college students, bathtub gin, home brew, home-made stills, moonshiners, hip flasks), but alcohol consumption was reduced by almost half; “Jake Walkers,” nervous disorder from drinking methyl and wood alcohol, were especially common during Prohibition. • Bootlegging grew (took in about $2 billion/year, about 2 percent of GNP); rumrunners flourished, particularly from Canada, Mexico, and West Indies. • Prohibition Bureau tried unsuccessfully to enforce it the law but had few employees and little federal money. • Organized crime rose: gang wars of Chicago; Scarface Al Capone; became a permanent part of United States society. • Eliot Ness and the FBI emerged as key figures in law enforcement. • Problems surfaced for the Democratic Party (e.g., election of 1928: Wets vs. Drys; Democrat Alfred E. Smith opposed Prohibition). • Liquor and brewing interests wanted repeal, as did the Association Against the Prohibition Amendments (founded in 1918, undertook publicity campaign in 1928). • In 1923 New York repealed its enforcement law; by 1930 six more states followed. • Report of Wickersham Commission, 1931, was appointed by Herbert Hoover; recognized widespread evasion of Prohibition and its negative effects on United States society, but still recommended additional enforcement of laws against alcohol (favored revising but did not call for repeal). o Reaction to Wickersham Commission report by Franklin P. Adams, New York World columnist: Prohibition is an awful flop. It’s left a trail of graft and slime, We like it. It don’t prohibit worth a dime, It can’t stop what it’s meant to stop. It’s filled our land with vice and crime. We like it. Nevertheless, we’re for it. • In 1932 the Democrats and Franklin Roosevelt strongly urged repeal in their election campaign. • Beer-Wine Revenue Act of 1932 allowed manufacture and sale of beer and light wine with a 3.2 percent alcohol content (with a tax levied on both) as an interim measure pending the repeal of Prohibition. • Prohibition was repealed in 1933 via the Twenty-first Amendment. Religion Origins • Modernism began in the 1870s as an attempt by liberal Protestants to make Christianity more relevant to contemporary life; Harry Emerson Fosdick. • Fundamentalism began to grow (conservative Protestants who tried to counter Modernism): o Fundamentalists wanted a return to fundamentals of Christian faith, e.g., virgin birth, resurrection of Jesus, literal reading of Bible. o Publication of The Fundamentals, 1910–1915, a series of essays affirming orthodox Protestant belief. o After 1920 some conservative Protestants began calling themselves “Fundamentalists.” o Fundamentalists rejected modern science, particularly Darwinian evolution, as inconsistent with revealed word of God; also rejected the Social Gospel. • William Jennings Bryan was seen as the foremost national leader of fundamentalism and opposition to evolution because of his prestige and eloquence. • Ideas that appeared to threaten biblical faith and religion included Darwinism, pragmatism, science, relativism of moral values, and psychology (Sigmund Freud). • Rural and small-town Americans felt threatened by urban, secular culture. • The Ku Klux Klan appealed to “traditional” Protestantism; anti-Catholicism (Hiram Wesley Evans), anti-Semitism; argued it was protecting traditional Protestantism and morality. • Anti-Catholicism and anti-Semitism made an appearance in larger society: o Clubs, resorts, and fraternal organizations prohibited Jews and Catholics. o Henry Ford sponsored the anti-Semitic Dearborn Independent. o Quotas were placed on Jews admitted to colleges and medical schools; Catholics created their own schools and colleges. o Some suburbs limited residents to “Christians.” Outcomes • Ku Klux Klan grew in the 1920s; it tried to institute compulsory Bible reading in schools and restrict parochial schools. • Some southern states attempted to prohibit teaching of evolution: by 1925 five southern states had passed laws restricting such teaching. • Scopes Trial took place in Dayton, Tennessee, in 1925 (ACLU; John T. Scopes; Clarence Darrow; William Jennings Bryan, who was hired by World Christian Fundamentalist Association; H. L. Mencken.
