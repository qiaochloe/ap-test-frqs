thereafter, the increase was minimal.  • Between 1824 and 1840, the percentage increase of eligible voters in United States presidential elections almost tripled, rising from 26.9 to 80.2 percent.  • The greatest increase occurred between 1824 and 1828, during which interval the percentage of eligible voters participating in United States presidential election more than doubled to 57.6 percent, a figure that leveled off until 1840.  • The second-greatest increase occurred between 1836 and 1840, when the percentage climbed from 57.8 to 80.2 percent.  Document Inferences • The period between James Madison’s reelection as president in 1812 and the election of William Henry Harrison in 1840 was a time of remarkable expansion of democratic participation in United States politics.  • In 1790, shortly after the American Revolution, only Vermont granted the vote to all free men; by 1840, all states but Rhode Island allowed all free men to vote.  • The notion of the Founding Fathers that only property owners had a stake in society that justified their having the ballot was now discredited.  • The United States probably had a higher percentage of men eligible to vote and a higher percentage of eligible men voting than any other country in the world, with the important caveats that women, American Indians, and black men could not vote.  • No longer was deference owed to elites, because the expanded electorate made their own decisions about how to vote.  Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  • This amazing development owed much to the logic of equality embedded in the American Revolution, the emergence of political parties, increasingly effective campaign strategies, polarizing social and economic issues, removal of voting impediments (e.g., property ownership and/or tax payments), relocation of polling areas to more convenient locations, and the rise of the popular press.  Potential Outside Information  abolitionism Adams, John Quincy Age of Jackson Age of the Common Man American System Anti-Masonic Party Bank of the United States Bank War Bucktails Calhoun, John C. Clay, Henry Clinton, DeWitt Crawford, William Democratic Party Democratic–Republican Party Distribution Act Era of Good Feelings Federalist Party freehold qualifications internal improvements Jackson, Andrew King, Rufus King Andrew I King Caucus Liberty Party Log Cabin campaign Madison, James Missouri Compromise Monroe, James National–Republican Party nullification Panic of 1819 Panic of 1837 property requirements protective tariffs Republican Party second party system Specie Circular temperance Tories 12th Amendment Virginia dynasty Webster, Daniel Whig Party Whigs White, Hugh Lawson wildcat banking Wirt, William Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Document B  Source: James Kent, Excerpt from the Proceedings and Debates of the Convention Assembled for the Purpose of Amending the Constitution of the State of New York, 1821.  That extreme democratic principle [universal suffrage] . . . has been regarded with terror by the wise men of every age because, in every European republic, ancient and modern, in which it has been tried, it has terminated disastrously and been productive of corruption, injustice, violence, and tyranny. . . .  The apprehended danger from the experiment of universal suffrage applied to the whole legislative department is no dream of the imagination. . . . The tendency of universal suffrage is to jeopardize the rights of property and the principles of liberty. There is a constant tendency . . . in the poor to covet and to share the plunder of the rich; in the debtor to relax or avoid the obligation of contracts; in the majority to tyrannize over the minority and trample down their rights; in the indolent and the profligate to cast the whole burdens of society upon the industrious and virtuous. . . . We are no longer to remain plain and simple republics of farmers. . . . We are fast becoming a great nation, with great commerce, manufactures, population, wealth, luxuries, and with the vices and miseries that they engender.  Document Information • At the state convention to revise New York’s constitution in 1821, James Kent warned that the United States had embarked on a perilous experiment involving democracy, namely, universal suffrage. • Such an experiment, Kent maintained, would inevitably end badly, in line with all previous attempts at European democratization.  • Kent warned that universal suffrage would undercut fundamental liberties because the more numerous poor would logically vote to confiscate private property owned by the relatively few wealthy.  • Such pressure on the wealthy was likely to increase because the economy of the United States no longer depended on yeoman farmers but on commerce and manufacturing.  • This changing economic reality had moved the United States well along the path of national greatness but would inevitably result in a variety of serious social ills.   Document Inferences • In the United States, the industrial and market revolutions in the late 18th and early 19th centuries had created a middle class of merchants, shopkeepers, and craftsmen who demanded a greater voice in running government affairs, particularly as their own economic well-being was affected.  • At bottom, this demand for political participation meant exercising the franchise without restriction.  • Calls for universal suffrage frightened prominent New Yorkers, such as attorney James Kent, a Federalist in the New York state legislature, the first law professor at Columbia College, and the chief judge of the state supreme court.  • Kent evidently studied the democratic experiments in ancient Greece, revolutionary France, and the republics in Latin America, which had just broken free of Spanish control, and concluded these democracies had turned out badly.  • Despite Kent’s fears, New York’s state constitution implemented important democratic provisions.  • For example, the constitution removed property qualifications for white male voters over the age  of 21, so that most adult white males could vote, provided they paid taxes or served in the militia.  • Most government offices were made elective, rather than appointive.  Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  • The Council of Appointment was abolished. In addition, the Council of Revision, which previously had the power to veto new legislation, was also dissolved, because the new constitution transferred the veto power to the elected governor, subject to be overridden by a two-thirds vote of the state legislature.  • Most states followed New York’s example in expanding their electorates without violence. An important exception was Rhode Island, which endured the Dorr Rebellion in 1841.  Potential Outside Information  Bucktails Clinton, DeWitt Dorr Rebellion King, Rufus Van Rensselaer, Stephen Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Document C  Source: Martin Van Buren, New York politician, to Thomas Ritchie, editor of the Richmond (Virginia) Enquirer, January 13, 1827.  I have long been satisfied that we can only . . . restore a better state of things, by combining Genl. Jackson’s personal popularity with the portion of old party feeling yet remaining. . . .   Its effects would be highly salutary on your section of the union by the revival of old party distinctions. We must always have party distinctions and the old ones are the best. . . . Political combinations between the inhabitants of the different states are unavoidable and the most natural and beneficial to the country is that between the planters of the South and the plain Republicans of the North. The country has once flourished under a party thus constituted and may again. It would take longer than our lives (even if it were practicable) to create new party feelings to keep those masses together. If the old ones are suppressed, geographical divisions founded on local interests, or what is worse prejudices between free and slaveholding states will inevitably take their place. Party attachment in former times furnished a complete antidote for sectional prejudices by producing counteracting feelings.  Document Information • In a letter to Richmond Enquirer editor Thomas Ritchie, New York politician Martin Van Buren maintained that the United States would be well served if old party distinctions could be resurrected.  • Van Buren thought that the best political combination would unite southern planters and “plain Republicans of the North.”  • Van Buren warned that the failure to revive this political coalition—which would be far easier than creating a new coalition from scratch—might exacerbate irresolvable tensions between free and slaveholding states.  Document Inferences • For Martin Van Buren, political parties were not aristocratic associations or threats to the Republic, but desirable engines of the popular will.  • Van Buren was part of a group of shrewd politicians called the Albany Regency who controlled New York’s state government in Albany between 1822 and 1838.  • This Albany Regency was one of America’s first political machines, and it influenced the Democratic–Republican party, first as the Bucktails faction and, later, as the Hunkers faction among the Jacksonian Democrats.  • With the help of their newspaper, the Albany Argus, they controlled party nominating conventions and political patronage (spoils system) while in office, although they were also opponents of corruption.  • Van Buren’s main interest was to elect Andrew Jackson, the Hero of New Orleans in the War of 1812, as president, an office denied him in 1824, despite the fact that Jackson had won a plurality of popular and electoral votes.  • Jacksonians blamed John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay for fashioning a “corrupt bargain” in the U.S. House of Representatives that gave Adams the presidency and Clay the position of secretary of state.  • By bridging the sectional divide, Van Buren thought he had found a winning electoral formula.  Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Potential Outside Information  Adams, John Quincy Albany Argus Albany Regency American System anti-Masonry Bucktails Clay, Henry congressional caucus “corrupt bargain” Crawford, William Democratic Party Freemasonry Jackson, Andrew King Caucus Little Magician Marcy, William Monroe, James Old Hero Old Hickory Old Kinderhook Old Republicans self-made man Seward, William Tariff of Abominations 12th Amendment Virginia dynasty Weed, Thurlow Wright, Silas Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Document D  Source: Democratic Party ballot, New Hampshire, 1828.    Courtesy of Library of Congress  Document Information • In 1828, the Democratic Party’s ballot for New Hampshire was led by “Jackson and the People’s Ticket.” Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Document Inferences • Andrew Jackson was an enormously popular political figure, and state candidates from the governor to the coroner tied themselves to his coattails in the hope of winning their elections in 1828.  • As the first political campaign that captured national attention, one million Americans voted for the first time — twice as many as in 1824 — thanks in part to the democratization of the voting process and new approaches to arouse political interest, such as huge public rallies, lavish picnics, and mudslinging charges of gambling, bigamy, and pimping.  • It was a veritable revolution in United States electioneering, as political operatives such as Martin Van Buren, Amos Kendall, and Thomas Ritchie created a candidate of the people and appealed for popular support.  • This was also the first election in which the popular vote determined the outcome of the race.  • With Jackson as the Democratic standard-bearer for a new kind of politicking, the Democratic Party controlled the White House for all but eight of the next 32 years.  Potential Outside Information  Adams, John Quincy Age of the Common Man American System Bank War barbecues Benton, Thomas Hart Biddle, Nicholas Calhoun, John C. Clay, Henry coffin handbills “corrupt bargain” Crawford, William dueling fire-eaters Force Bill gag rule hard money Hero of New Orleans hickory poles Jackson, Andrew Jackson, Rachel Jacksonian democracy Kendall, Amos King Mob National–Republican Party Nullification party convention pet banks presidential vetoes Randolph, John Ritchie, Thomas rotation in office secession Seminole Wars South Carolina Exposition and Protest Specie Circular spoils system states’ rights Taney, Roger torchlight parades tyranny of the majority Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Document E  Source: George H.

Evans, a founder of the Working Man’s Party, insists that the laboring classes of New York City have been betrayed by self-seeking politicians.  • Evans urges his fellow workers to declare forthrightly that they are equally entitled to a just and satisfying life and to use all lawful means to attain this better life.  Document Inferences • The Working Man’s Party invoked the revolutionary language of Richard Henry Lee in protesting labor injustices, including excessive hours, nonpayment of wages, imprisonment for debt, child labor, and dismissal for forming unions.  • Many other issues disturbed workers: lack of (or charges for) children’s education, poll taxes, the wealthy’s escape from militia service, and state-granted monopolies that protected businessmen.  • Labor parties faded quickly for several reasons, including the inexperience of labor politicians, which left the parties prey to manipulation by political professionals; the duplication of some causes by major parties; the vulnerability that charges of radicalism or dilettantism posed; and internal divisions into warring factions.  • Once workingmen’s parties failed, workers usually joined the Jacksonian Democrats.  Potential Outside Information  bank-note currency boom-bust business cycle carpenters chartered monopoly child labor closed shop Commonwealth v.

All I ever heard against him was, that “he was too much of a gentleman”; but a new candidate must be set up, and Mr. Adams was out-voted for no other reason, that I could learn, but because it was “best to change.” “Jackson for ever!” was, therefore, screamed from the mouths, both drunk and sober, till he was elected; but no sooner in his place, than the same ceaseless operation went on again, with “Clay for ever” for its war-whoop.  Document Information • Frances Trollope, a foreigner, observed that Americans drummed John Quincy Adams out of the presidency, even though he was well suited to the office.  • The key motivation for Adams’s defeat, Trollope observed, was that “change” was highly valued, politically speaking, and Adams was yesterday’s news.  • Andrew Jackson captured the presidency as a result of this mindset, but as soon as he entered the White House, the cries for his ouster arose.  Document Inferences • The emerging nation of the United States fascinated, when it did not repel, European travelers who came to see this latest incarnation among nation-states.  • Three of the best-known travelers who wrote books that discussed their observations and insights were Alexis de Tocqueville, Harriet Martineau, and Frances Trollope.  • Trollope was an English writer whose travels in America in the late 1820s and residence in the frontier town of Cincinnati, Ohio, helped form her generally caustic opinion of Americans (especially men) as loud, inebriated, vulgar, and unsophisticated.  • Though she recognized some American virtues, Trollope’s witty and satirical book Domestic Manners of the Americans combines travelogue and social commentary, and it created a sensation on both sides of the Atlantic.  • Trollope was appalled by religious emotionalism at evangelical camp meetings and by gauche American practices such as eating foot-long watermelon slices in public, tossing pigtails in flowerbeds, and vomiting at the theater.  • More profoundly, she criticized the obsession of Americans with making money and their ignoring the cruelty of slavery.  • Given Trollope’s low opinion of Americans, especially because she observed they had a predilection for whiskey, one can conclude that she disapproved of universal suffrage for white males.  • Although Frances Trollope criticized American society for its egalitarianism, she did not realize or appreciate that the United States, unlike England, allowed most groups to advance economically precisely because there were few social restraints.   Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Potential Outside Information  Beecher, Lyman  benevolent empire burned-over district camp meetings Channing, William Ellery  cult of self-improvement Democracy in America democratic leveling  Emerson, Ralph Waldo  Finney, Charles Grandison  lyceums Mann, Horace manufactured textiles Martineau, Harriet mesmerism moral suasion Nashoba Commune Noyes, John Humphrey Oneida Community Over-soul pantaloons phrenology Poe, Edgar Allen revivalism Second Great Awakening self-reliance short hair Society in America spiritualism spoils system Sunday School Union Tappan, Lewis technology temperance tobacco chewing Tocqueville, Alexis de  transcendentalism utopianism Whitman, Walt Wright, FannyQuestion 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Document G    Document Information • The number of different newspapers in the United States increased from 31 in 1775 to 1,200 in 1835, with the number more than tripling between 1810 and 1835.  Document Inferences • Although some elites associated newspapers with a degenerate subculture found in taverns and gambling dens, newspapers were the most widely distributed reading material of the early 19th century.  • With Americans having one of the highest literacy rates ever recorded, they were attracted to the new print culture that encouraged them to read, think, and vote according to their own desires.  • Increasingly, Americans found politics and ordinary events worth reading about, particularly after technological and journalistic innovations made newspapers ubiquitous, affordable, and readable.   Potential Outside Information  correspondents crime daily newspaper editorials First Amendment freedom of the press gossip human interest stories Jefferson, Thomas money page newsboys penny press public schools reporters Romantic movement sentimental novels tabloid journalism Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Document H  Source: David Crockett, Colonel Crockett’s Exploits and Adventures in Texas, 1837.  When the day of election approaches, visit your constituents far and wide. Treat liberally, and drink freely, in order to rise in their estimation, though you fall in your own. True, you may be called a drunken dog by some of the clean-shirt and silk-stocking gentry, but the real roughnecks will style you a jovial fellow. Their votes are certain, and frequently count double.   Do all you can to appear to advantage in the eyes of the women. That’s easily done. You have but to kiss and slabber their children, wipe their noses, and pat them on the head. This cannot fail to please their mothers, and you may rely on your business being done in that quarter.  Promise all that is asked, said I, and more if you can think of anything. Offer to build a bridge or a church, to divide a county, create a batch of new offices, make a turnpike, or anything they like. Promises cost nothing; therefore, deny nobody who has a vote or sufficient influence to obtain one.  Get up on all occasions, and sometimes on no occasion at all, and make long-winded speeches, though composed of nothing else than wind. Talk of your devotion to country, your modesty and disinterestedness, or any such fanciful subject.

In 1584 Britain authorized privateers to act against its rivals. In 1585 Britain established a colony called Roanoke; this was unsuccessful. Other exploration and settlement had to be put on hold because of religious disputes between Catholics and Protestants following Henry VIII’s break with the Catholic Church. With that dispute settled, and encouraged by the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588, England quickly caught up with its European rivals. Like the French, the English sailed to the New World in search of a short route to Asia. Other English motives included generating benefits for investors who underwrote joint-stock companies and settlement, finding raw materials for England’s growing industrial economy, and mercantilism. Mercantilism involved accumulating wealth in the form of precious metals, establishing colonies, and maintaining a positive balance of trade between home country and colony.  Jamestown, founded in the colony of Virginia in 1607, was England’s first permanent settlement. Plymouth and the Massachusetts Bay Colony followed in 1620 and 1630. Six of England’s original colonies were founded before 1640. Six others were established or came under English rule during the Restoration era, between 1660 and 1688. Georgia, the last, was settled in the 1730s.  By the late 1600s England’s American colonies, as a consequence of years of salutary neglect, had developed their own unique cultures and economies while retaining much of their basically English character. Settlers came to the American colonies in the hope of improving their economic lot or to gain greater religious or political freedom. The English American colonies were not demographically homogenous. Wealthy colonists were politically more powerful, and their interests were not necessarily consistent with the interests of those less well off.  Just as Britain and France were rivals in Europe, they became rivals in North America. Continental wars between France and Britain (and usually Spain) spilled over into North America and were nearly constant from 1689 to 1763. As each nation’s imperial goals came to include being the dominant power in North America, they fought for control of the continent. King William’s War (War of the League of Augsburg), 1689–1697; Queen Anne’s War (War of the Spanish Succession), 1702–1713; and the War of Jenkins’s Ear, 1739–1748, which merged with King George’s War (War of the Austrian Succession), 1744–1748 were all inconclusive.  The French and Indian War began in North America in 1754 and merged with Europe’s Seven Years’ War, thus lasting nine years (1754–1763). It was decisive and left France temporarily with no major territorial possessions in North America.  French Imperial Goals in North America between 1580 and 1763  Like the Spanish, the French goal was to explore as much land as possible in hope of finding mineral wealth, like gold, and a shortcut to Asia. In 1524 France sent Giovanni da Verrazano to search for a northwest passage to Asia. Between 1534 and 1543 Jacques Cartier made three voyages and sailed up the St. Lawrence River, searching for a rumored wealthy kingdom. Also like the Spanish, French missionaries tried to convert Native Americans to Roman Catholicism. France also established permanent settlements, as did the Spanish. Unlike the Spanish, the French settled in the less hospitable  Question 2 (continued)  northern climate of New France (Quebec and Nova Scotia), and the French government provided little incentive for citizens to venture to the New World and settle in this cold area. As a result, the French had a lesser impact on native peoples than did the Spanish. Few French settlers came to North America, and New France remained sparsely populated.  The early French arrivals tended to be single men who stayed on the move (coureurs du bois). Not until 1608 did the French make serious inroads into acquiring lucrative assets in North America, such as beaver pelts, which were in high demand in Europe. This trade led to the colonization of Quebec City that same year.  In 1625 the French government strengthened its intent to spread Roman Catholicism by declaring that only Catholicism could be practiced in New France. After 1630 the Jesuits worked particularly hard to Christianize New France. Steps were also taken to ensure that New France would be permanent. French soldiers were sent to the territory, and several hundred young women were sent over in order to provide a supply of brides. Minister Colbert offered bonuses to couples who produced large families. In 1673 Father Marquette and a trader, Louis Joliet, traveled down the Mississippi River in search of a passage to the Pacific. They turned back when they became convinced that the Mississippi emptied into the Gulf of Mexico. In 1682 Réné-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle traveled down the Mississippi and claimed the entire Mississippi River Valley for France, calling it Louisiana. In 1718 the city of New Orleans was established.  The French expansion into the interior confined the British to territory east of the Appalachians. A turning point came for the French with the War of the Spanish Succession and the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. France, on the losing side, lost Newfoundland and Nova Scotia to Britain. France tried hard to strengthen its position in North America. The French erected their fortress at Louisbourg and built forts on Lake Champlain and on the Great Lakes. In 1745 Louisbourg fell to the British, largely owing to the efforts of British American colonists. The fortress was returned to France with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which ended King George’s War (War of the Austrian Succession) in 1748. The small population of New France proved to be a handicap to French efforts to counter the growing British presence in North America during the early 1700s. By 1750 British settlers outnumbered the French  3 to 1. The Louisiana territory was ceded to Spain in 1763. When Britain triumphed in the French and Indian War (1754–1763), France temporarily had no major territorial possessions in North America: Britain controlled the continent east of the Mississippi, and Spain claimed the land west of the Mississippi.  Spanish Imperial Goals in North America between 1580 and 1763  For most of the sixteenth century Spain was the most important colonial power in the western hemisphere. Spain’s initial goals were to explore the New World, find mineral wealth, and extract it for the benefit of Spain. Spain hung on to Columbus’s goal of finding a passage to the Far East. Advanced weapons and a good deal of ruthlessness allowed the conquistadors to dominate the New World. The Spanish Armada made it difficult for other European nations to send competing expeditions. Initially, the Spanish gave little thought to colonizing and spent their time searching for precious metals. The Spanish found success in Central and South America and the West Indies, where they collected and exported as much of the local wealth as possible. After finding no cities of gold in the American West, Spain concluded that the gold and silver found in Mexico and Peru did not exist north of the Rio Grande.  Question 2 (continued)  By 1580 Spain’s primary goal was to establish and defend a mercantilist policy that would reserve to Spain all the rewards the New World had to offer. The Spanish concentrated their efforts on extracting Mexican and Peruvian mineral wealth and shipping it back to Europe.   Spain’s secondary goal became the creation of a mixed Indian and Spanish culture that would incorporate Spanish customs. The conquistadors enslaved the Native Americans on encomiendas. The encomienda system gave settlers authority over Native American labor and obliged the settlers to Christianize them. The Spanish sought to impose Spanish culture and religion on the indigenous peoples. When the conquistadors faded away, Spanish missionaries carried on, particularly in the North American Southwest. When other European countries showed interest in North America, Spain responded by establishing permanent settlements, first at St. Augustine (1565) and later at Santa Fe (1610).  Following the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588, Spain began a descent to second-rate world power. By the 1640s the economic benefits available to Spain from its presence in the New World began to decline. Spain’s imperial goal shifted to maintaining but not expanding its presence in North America.  Time Line and Background Information  1492  Christopher Columbus arrives, searching for a passage to India on behalf of Spain.  1492  Spain and Portugal, with influence from the pope, agree to the Treaty of Tordesillas, dividing the world between the two Catholic countries. All of the western hemisphere except Brazil was assigned to Spain. Other countries did not take this seriously, but Spain and Portugal had an advantage in terms of preparedness to explore North America.  1511  Spain begins planning to explore the North American mainland to the west.   1513  Ponce de Leon lands in and claims Florida.  1513  Vasco Núñez de Balboa crosses the Isthmus of Panama and discovers the Pacific Ocean. Initially, the Spanish ventured to North and South America in search of precious metals and thought little of colonization or permanent settlement.  1519  Hernán Cortés and his army land at Vera Cruz, Mexico, and march to Tenochtitlan, where the conquistadores easily plunder the Aztec riches. By 1521 diseases — primarily smallpox — had greatly weakened the Aztecs. To the south, Francisco Pizarro marched through the Inca Empire, captured the capital city, executed the Inca chief, and began exploiting Peru’s silver mines.  1540  Francisco Vásquez de Coronado and an army of 300 venture into the American Southwest from Mexico, attack Pueblo settlements, find no gold or silver, and conclude that the gold and silver found in Mexico and Peru does not exist elsewhere in the Americas.  1540s  Spain locates the silver mines at Potosi (Bolivia) that became a major source of Spain’s wealth for the next 100 years.  1565  St. Augustine (Florida) established.  1570  Jesuits establish a mission in what is today Virginia.  1573   King Philip II of Spain decrees it illegal to enslave American Indians or forcibly extract tribute from them.  1577–1580  Francis Drake plunders Spanish possessions along the Pacific coast and continues west to circumnavigate the world.  1585  An English expedition lands on Roanoke Island, but the colony established lasted only a short time.  Question 2 (continued)  1587  Sir Walter Raleigh sends a second expedition to Roanoke Island. It includes women. This was to be a permanent settlement, but the colonists disappeared.  1604  Samuel Champlain establishes a French settlement in Acadia.  1607  The London group of the Virginia Company sends three ships to the Chesapeake Bay area and establishes the colony at Jamestown. Of 325 settlers who reached Jamestown before 1609, fewer than 100 were still alive in the spring of 1609.  1608  France colonizes Quebec City.  1609  First Powhatan War begins, lasting for five years.  1610  Spanish found Santa Fe, New Mexico.  1613  John Rolfe imports a new strain of tobacco, which soon becomes in great demand.  1619  Africans reach Virginia. Their status was ambiguous.  1620  The Pilgrims (separatists from the Church of England) arrive on the Mayflower and establish the Plymouth Colony.  1624  King of England declares the Virginia Company bankrupt, assumes direct control of Virginia, and makes Jamestown the first royal colony.  1630  Puritans, led by John Winthrop, arrive and establish the Massachusetts Bay Colony.  1632  Maryland Charter makes Lord Baltimore, a Catholic, proprietor of the Maryland Colony.  1636  Roger Williams flees Massachusetts and settles in what becomes Rhode Island.  1638  Anne Hutchinson is banished from Massachusetts.  1642–1651  English Civil War.  1649  Toleration Act grants freedom of religion to Christians in Maryland.  1649  Parliament beheads Charles I and proclaims a commonwealth, eventually headed by Oliver Cromwell.  1650  Parliament bans foreign ships from English colonies.  1651  Navigation Acts of 1651, aimed at Dutch competition, are passed by Parliament.  1660  Restoration of Charles II to the British throne.   1660  Navigation Acts of 1651 are extended to require that all colonial goods traded must be carried on English ships. Enumerated commodities, such as sugar and tobacco, were to be shipped from the colony of origin only to England or to another English colony.  1663  Louis XIV and his minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, take direct charge of the French colony. Agriculture was encouraged, and women were transported over to marry the men.  1663  Charter is granted to eight men for the Carolina Colony.  1664  James, duke of York, receives a charter for a colony that becomes New York.  1665  New Jersey is made a separate colony from New York.  1673  Plantation Duty Act requires captains of colonial ships to post bond in the colonies to ensure that they would deliver all enumerated commodities to England, or else pay on the spot the duties that would be owed in England. The act was designed to eliminate incentives to smuggle. It also established customs officials in all English colonies.  1675–1676  Metacom’s War (also known as King Philip’s War) begins in June 1675 and ends in 1676 with a decisive military victory for the British colonists.  1676  Bacon’s Rebellion.  1680  Pope’s Rebellion (also known as the Pueblo Revolt). A Pueblo Indian named Pope organizes the most successful Native American revolt in American history, temporarily gaining control of New Mexico from the Spanish.  1681  William Penn gains a charter for the colony of Pennsylvania.  1682  Réné-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle travels down to the mouth of the Mississippi River, claims the entire area for France, and names it Louisiana.  Question 2 (continued)  1688  William III and Mary II are named joint sovereigns of Great Britain after James II flees to France in what is known as the Glorious Revolution.  1689–1697  King William’s War.  1690s  South Carolina plantation develops rice agriculture, possibly originating with African slaves. Rice quickly became the staple export and triggered a massive growth of slavery to provide labor for plantations.  1690–1691  Competition from France in the Gulf of Mexico prompts the Spanish to move into Texas and establish missions.  1691  Massachusetts’s new charter grants the king the right to appoint governors and merges Plymouth and Maine with Massachusetts.  1700  England possesses about 20 colonies in North America and the West Indies; colonial and Asian commerce accounts for 30–40 percent of England’s overseas trade; and London is the largest city in western Europe.  1700–1740  A massive influx of slaves lays the foundation for a society (the Old South) consisting of wealthy slaveholding planters, a much larger class of small planters, and thousands of slaves. By 1720 slaves made up 70 percent of South Carolina’s population, 40 percent of Virginia’s population, and almost 30 percent of Maryland’s population.  1701  Five Nations of the Iroquois negotiate a peace treaty with the French and the western American Indians in which they agree to remain neutral in any war between France and England. Encouraged by a new French fort at Detroit, American Indians begin to return to the fertile lands around Lake Erie and Lake Huron.  1702–1713  Queen Anne’s War. French and American Indians destroy Deerfield, Massachusetts. New England and the British capture Acadia and rename it Nova Scotia.  1716–1720  To counter French efforts to hold on to the Gulf of Mexico, Spain sends missionaries and soldiers into Texas, establishing a capital at Los Adaes.  1717–1721  French Company of the Indies ships thousand of settlers and slaves to Louisiana. In fewer than 10 years half had died or fled.  1718  French found New Orleans.  1739  Spanish governor of Florida offers liberty to any slave from the British colonies. This, rumors about Fort Mose (first community in Florida for free blacks), and religious and personal reasons combine to touch off the Stono Rebellion in South Carolina.   1739–1748  War of Jenkins’s Ear starts a new era of imperial war.   1742  Philip V of Spain sends 36 ships and more than 1,000 soldiers from Cuba with instructions to devastate Georgia and South Carolina and free the slaves. Georgians ambushed two patrols, and Spanish morale collapsed.  1744  France joins Spain in the war against Britain (now called King George’s War).   1745  French fortress, Louisbourg, on Cape Breton Island, falls to the British.  1748  Louisbourg is returned to the French with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.  1750  To protect English industries, Parliament passes the Iron Act, which prohibited the erection of certain types of iron mills.  1754  Confrontation between Virginia forces under George Washington and French forces near the forks of the Ohio River starts the French and Indian War.  1754  The Albany Congress is convened to meet with the Iroquois to encourage them not to side with France. Benjamin Franklin’s Albany Plan proposed a form of colonial unity, but every colony rejected it.  1756  Britain declares war on France, and the colonial contest merges into the Seven Years’ War. By 1758 it was clear that the British Empire finally had put together a military force capable of overwhelming New France.  Question 2 (continued)  1762  Spain enters the war in an attempt to prevent a total British victory.  1763  The Peace of Paris ends the war. France surrendered to Britain all of North America east of the Mississippi, except for New Orleans. In exchange for Havana, Spain ceded Florida to Britain. To compensate its Spanish ally, France gave New Orleans and all of Louisiana west of the Mississippi to Spain.  1763  With a unity never seen before, American Indians attack in the West in a conflict known as Pontiac’s War.    1763  The Paxton Boys murder a number of American Indians along the Pennsylvania frontier.    1764  Parliament passes the Sugar Act, the Quartering Act, and the Currency Act.  1765  Parliament passes the Stamp Act.  1769  San Diego is established by Spain.  1795  Pinckney’s Treaty sets the border between the United States and Spanish Florida.  1819  In the Adams–Onís Treaty, the United States gains rights to all of Florida.   Question 3  Analyze the ways in which the political, economic, and diplomatic crises of the 1780s shaped the provisions of the United States Constitution.  The 8–9 Essay • Contains a clear, well-developed thesis that addresses the ways in which the political, economic, and diplomatic crises of the 1780s shaped the provisions of the United States Constitution. • Develops the thesis with substantial and relevant historical information. • Provides effective analysis of the topic; treatment of multiple parts may be somewhat uneven, but this does not detract from the overall quality of the essay. • May contain minor errors that do not detract from the quality of the essay. • Is well organized and well written.  The 5–7 Essay • Contains a partially developed thesis that addresses the ways in which the political, economic, and diplomatic crises of the 1780s shaped the provisions of the United States Constitution. • Supports the thesis with some relevant historical information. • Provides some analysis of the topic, but treatment of multiple parts may be uneven. • May contain errors that do not seriously detract from the quality of the essay. • Has acceptable organization and writing.  The 2–4 Essay • Contains an unfocused or limited thesis that addresses the ways in which the political, economic, and diplomatic crises of the 1780s shaped the provisions of the United States Constitution or that simply paraphrases the question. • Provides minimal relevant information or lists facts with little or no application to the question. • May address the question only partially, with limited or no analysis. • May have major errors. • May be poorly organized and/or written.  The 0–1 Essay • Lacks a thesis or simply restates the question. • Demonstrates an incompetent or inappropriate response. • Has numerous errors. • Is organized and/or written so poorly that it inhibits understanding.  The ─ Essay • Is completely off topic or blank. Question 3 (continued)  Information Sheet  The 1780s witnessed a string of political, economic, and foreign policy problems, earning it the name of the “critical period” in many U.S. history textbooks.   The American Revolution was followed by a severe economic depression in 1784 and 1785, forcing many states to impose charges on goods from other states to raise revenue. In addition, the national government was on the verge of bankruptcy, and a shortage of hard currency made it difficult to do business. Many of the nation’s fledgling industries were flooded by British imports. Economic problems were especially pronounced in the South, where planters lost about 60,000 slaves during the Revolution and suffered under the new British trade regulations that prohibited the southern states from selling many of their agricultural products in the British West Indies, previously one of the South’s leading markets.   In addition, Britain violated the Peace Treaty of Paris by refusing to evacuate its military posts because the states would not restore loyalist property that had been confiscated during the Revolution. At the same time, Spain failed to recognize U.S. claims to territory between the Ohio River and Florida and in 1784 closed the Mississippi River to U.S. trade.   Having not yet implemented the Constitution, the United States was operating under an inadequate framework of government that many leaders felt threatened its independence. By 1787 many of the nation’s leaders were especially concerned that the tyrannical majorities in state legislatures threatened fundamental freedoms, including freedom of religion and the rights of property holders.  The Constitutional Convention of 1787 produced the most enduring written Constitution ever created. Though the United States existed prior to the ratification of the Constitution, it was a nation held together by the tenuous threads of the Articles of Confederation, a sometimes contentious, and often ineffectual national government. The men who were at Philadelphia that hot summer hammered out a document that was the result of dozens of compromises and shaped by the failures of the Unites States under the Articles as well as the failures of all well-known European governments of the time.  Political Problems: 1780s • The federal government had not been able to either fund the Revolutionary War or pay the war debt under the Articles of Confederation.  • The states — which had borrowed money from individual creditors to fund the war — were by the mid-1780s heavily taxing landowners (farmers in particular) to pay their debts.  • The states were demanding hard money, not paper. Impoverished farmers were unable to pay and feared loss of their land.  • This situation resulted in Shays’ Rebellion in Massachusetts, which some historians view as a major impetus to the replacement of the Articles of Confederation by the Constitution.  • Once the Constitution was ratified, control of funding and repayment of the debt passed to the federal government.  Question 3 (continued)  Economic Problems: 1780s • Depression of 1784: Severe economic downturn resulting from low production, an insufficient hard money supply, and few opportunities to export goods. • The Depression of 1784 helped to convince the nation that the central government created by the Articles of Confederation was too weak and that a new, stronger federal government with the power to issue currency, create tariffs, and regulate commerce was essential to national prosperity. • During the Revolutionary War, the government had used loan-office certificates and continental certificates to pay for supplies as well as to pay soldiers and officers. These non-interest-bearing notes quickly lost their value after the war. The holders of the certificates were for the most part farmers, small businessmen, and merchants, who all needed cash to operate their farms and businesses. Therefore, they had little recourse but to sell their certificates at rates of 10 or 20 cents on the dollar. By the mid-1780s the majority of these certificates were in the possession of a few wealthy speculators.   Diplomatic Problems: 1780s • 1780: Russia proclaims “armed neutrality,” which helps the Patriot side in the Revolutionary War. • 1780–1781: Russia and Austria propose peace terms; rejected by John Adams. • 1781: Benjamin Franklin, Henry Laurens, and Thomas Jefferson are named to assist Adams in peace negotiations; Congress insists on independence; all else is negotiable. • 1782: The Netherlands recognizes United States independence and signs a treaty of commerce and friendship; Dutch bankers loan $2 million for war supplies. • 1783: Treaty of Paris ends the Revolutionary War; U.S. boundaries are confirmed as British North America on the north, the Mississippi River on the west, Florida on the south. • 1783: U.S. signs a commercial treaty with Sweden. • 1784: British allow trade with the United States but forbid some U.S. food exports to the West Indies; British exports to United States reach £3.7 million, while imports of U.S. goods to Britain are only £750,000; imbalance causes a shortage of gold in the United States. • 1784: New York–based merchants open the China trade, followed by merchants in Salem, Boston, and Philadelphia. • 1785: Adams is appointed first minister to Great Britain; Jefferson replaces Franklin as minister to France. • 1789: Jay–Gardoqui Treaty with Spain gives Spain the exclusive right to navigate the Mississippi River for 30 years; not ratified because of western opposition.  Names and Terms  Annapolis Meeting, 1785–1786 Anti-Federalists Articles of Confederation, 1781–1788 (weaknesses: no power to tax, regulate commerce, or raise an army) Bill of Rights (ratified 1791) Constitution (strengths: can tax, regulate commerce, and raise an army) Constitutional Convention, 1787 Federalist Papers Federalists Great Compromise (Roger Sherman, Connecticut) Hamilton, Alexander Land Ordinance of 1785 Madison, James Newburgh Conspiracy, 1783 New Jersey Plan (William Paterson) Northwest Ordinance of 1787 (no slavery) Old Northwest Paterson, William Pinckney, Charles Shays’ Rebellion, 1785–1786 Sherman, Roger slavery Treaty of Paris, 1783 Virginia Plan (James Madison) Question 4  Compare and contrast the foreign policies of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.  The 8–9 Essay • Contains a clear, well-developed thesis that compares and contrasts the foreign policies of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. • Develops the thesis with substantial, relevant historical information. • Provides effective analysis of the foreign policies of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson; treatment may be somewhat uneven. • May contain minor errors that do not detract from the quality of the essay. • Is well organized and well written.  The 5–7 Essay • Contains a partially developed thesis that compares and contrasts the foreign policies of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. • Supports the thesis with some relevant historical information. • Provides some analysis of the foreign policies of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, but treatment may be uneven. • May contain errors that do not seriously detract from the quality of the essay. • Has acceptable organization and writing.  The 2–4 Essay • Contains an unfocused or limited thesis or one that simply paraphrases the question. • Provides minimal relevant information or lists facts with little or no application to the question. • May address the question only partially, with limited or no analysis. • May have major errors. • May be poorly organized and/or written.  The 0–1 Essay • Lacks a thesis or simply restates the question. • Demonstrates an incompetent or inappropriate response. • Has numerous errors. • Is organized and/or written so poorly that it inhibits understanding.  The — Essay • Is completely off topic or blank.  Question 4 (continued)  Information Sheet  The beginning of the twentieth century saw a new era in world politics. The cornerstone of what Henry Luce would later dub “The American Century” having been laid with the Spanish–American War in 1898, the United States stood ready to play a more active part in shaping world affairs. Although this shift in the nation’s approach to the conduct of diplomacy had begun before 1898, it was only in the early twentieth century that the nation’s policymakers assumed the new responsibility of helping orchestrate international affairs.   Between 1901 and 1920, the United States increasingly intervened in the affairs of other nations. The presidents during this period, Theodore Roosevelt, William Taft, and Woodrow Wilson, despite differences in background and temperament, held similar views regarding the redemptive nature of United States values and the nation’s obligation to further Western civilization. Each subscribed to the notion that political advancement and economic progress were two sides of the same coin, that democracy and republicanism were corollaries of free trade. All three championed policies that, in their estimation, furthered both.  If their opinions and actions were similar, their effect on long-term policymaking was not. The administrations of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson bookend the Progressive Era. They established the key principles that would animate United States foreign policy for the remainder of the century and beyond.  Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson were both Progressives, and their domestic proclivities colored their approach to foreign affairs. Both men promoted federal intervention in the nation’s economy to free Americans from the subjugation of big business. This penchant for activism shaped their statecraft as well. Each man willingly deployed United States power to free the people of other nations from what he saw as despotism and enslavement.   They believed in the centrality of decisive leadership in foreign affairs. As a result, both were impatient with Congress’s role in dealings with other countries. Throughout their tenures, each man worked to minimize the legislature’s capacity to impact events. So, too, did they work to minimize the role of the State Department, marginalizing it by relying on friends and personal contacts rather than professional diplomats whenever possible. Among the consequences of this point of view was the establishment of precedents that would accelerate the evolution of the imperial presidency.  Despite their push to expand presidential prerogatives in the conduct of foreign affairs, both men understood that there were constraints regarding what they could do and limits on what they could achieve. Roosevelt and Wilson understood that the public’s enthusiasm for empire was past, and, with rare exceptions, neither added substantially to United States territory. Though each understood the public’s aversion to foreign entanglements, they differed in their willingness to test the boundaries of that dislike. And, even though an arrogance of power generally marked their undertakings in Latin America and the Caribbean basin, they appreciated the checks on the ability of the United States to influence developments in Asia and drew back from that region.  Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson shared a desire to move the United States into the mainstream of world power but chose different means to do so. The more pragmatic of the two, Roosevelt was less ambitious than Wilson and, in many ways, the more successful. He saw the United States as a global adjudicator, whereas Wilson hoped to remake the world in the image of the  United States. Question 4 (continued)  Each of these men can be seen as transformative leaders. But of the two, Woodrow Wilson towers over United States foreign policy. Wilson was certain of his and the nation’s destiny. Sure that American values were both unique and universal, he thus believed no conflict existed between pushing the nation’s ideals and furthering its self-interests. The fate of his grandest initiatives aside, the term “Wilsonian” is firmly ensconced in the lexicon of United States foreign policy. This term conjures notions of anti-imperialism, self-determination, and the obligation of nations to act in concert in order to ensure peace and spread democracy.   Notwithstanding their many accomplishments, these two presidents left a mixed legacy. In Latin America, their confidence in the providential nature of United States initiatives translated into a high-handedness that tarnished how the United States was, and still is, seen in the region. Although a degree of United States dominance in the region was an unavoidable reality, efforts to “Americanize” Latin America and to make it secure for United States investment created economic instability and retarded the development of representative government.   With respect to Europe, the First World War accelerated the transformation of the global role of the United States, and Woodrow Wilson deserves much of the credit. Yet President Wilson’s hopes for “a peace without victory” collapsed when the 1919 Treaty of Versailles was rejected by the U.S. Senate. His vision for a peaceful future based on the Fourteen Points did not become reality.   Significant Events and Individuals  Associated with the Foreign Policies of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson  Events and Terms Associated with Theodore Roosevelt  Algeciras Conference (1906) American China Development Company annexation of Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico annexation of the Philippines anti-imperialists arbitration treaties (Asia/Latin America) Article 231 (1919) big stick diplomacy Boxer Rebellion (1900) China China Consortium (1909) Cuba dollar diplomacy gentlemen’s agreement (1907) Great White Fleet (1907) Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty (1903) Hay–Pauncefote Treaty (1901) insular cases (1901–1903) Manchuria Mexican Revolution (1910) Monroe Doctrine (1823) Nicaraguan intervention (1911) Nobel Peace Prize (Roosevelt, 1906) Open Door Notes Panama Canal (1904–1914) Platt Amendment (1901) Rio de Janiero Conference (1906) Roosevelt Corollary (1905) Root–Takahira Agreement (1908) Russo–Japanese War (1904–1905) Second Hague Conference (1907) Spanish–American War (1898) Taft–Katsura memo (1905) Treaty of Paris (1898) Treaty of Portsmouth (1905) Venezuelan crisis (1905)  Question 4 (continued)  Events and Terms Associated with Woodrow Wilson  Allies, the American Expeditionary Force (1917) Armistice (1918) Article X of the League of Nations Covenant “association of nations” (1916) Belleau Woods (1918) Black Hand  “blank check” (1914) Bryan–Chamorro Treaty (1914) Central Powers Château-Thierry, battle of (1918) Columbus, New Mexico, raid on (1916) Committee on Public Information (1917) “community of power” (1917) Dominican intervention (1916) Espionage and Sedition Acts (1917) Fourteen Points (1917) Gore–McLemore Resolution (1915) Haitian intervention (1911, 1916) House–Grey memorandum (1916) irreconcilables Lansing–Ishi Agreement (1917) League of Nations League to Enforce Peace (1916) Liberty Leagues Lusitania (1915) “make the world safe for democracy” Meuse–Argonne Offensive (1918) National Defense Act (1916) National Security League (1915) October Revolution (1917) pan-American mediation (1917) “peace without victory” (1917) Pershing expedition (1916) preparedness (1916) Provisional Government, Russia (1917) Red Scare (1919–1920) Russian Revolution (1917) Sarajevo (1914) strong and weak reservationists submarine crisis (1915) Sussex Pledge (1916) Tampico incident (1914) Treaty of Versailles (1919) Twenty-One Demands, made by Japan on China (1915) Underwood–Simmons tariff (1913) unlimited submarine warfare (1917) Vera Cruz, occupation of (1914) Virgin Islands (1916) “war to end all wars” Weimar Republic Zimmerman telegram (1917)  Individuals  Aguinaldo, Emilio Beveridge, Albert Bryan, William Jennings Bullitt, William C. Bunau-Varilla, Philippe Carranza, Venustiano Clemenceau, Georges Creel, George Edward VII, king of England Franz Ferdinand, archduke of Austria Franz Joseph I, emperor of Austria Harding, Warren Hay, John House, Edward Huerta, Victoriano Hughes, Charles Evans Kerensky, Alexander Knox, Philander Lansing, Robert Lenin, Vladimir Lloyd George, David Lodge, Henry Cabot Madero, Francisco McKinley, William Nicholas II, tsar of Russia Orlando, Vittorio Palmer, A.

Civil rights foundation: For both movements the issue of civil rights for African Americans was one of the principal catalysts for moral reform and the rights of women. For the 19th-century movement it was abolitionism; for the later 20th century it was the civil rights movement. In both cases African American civil rights activism provided the gateway to increased consciousness and activism for women’s rights.  2. Middle-class leadership and movement participation: For both movements the leadership and overall movement participation was a middle-class experience. In both cases poor women did not have the time or resources to participate, nor did they find their identity with the reform movement. 3. Successful in effecting change: Both movements were effective in arguing for and enlarging women’s roles and in bringing about tangible change in United States society.   Contrast Some ways in which the two eras of the women’s rights movement differ from one another: 1. Citizenship and voting rights versus individual fulfillment: Proponents of the earlier movement anchored themselves in the argument of morality and citizenship. It was a positive association that women were equally moral as men and deserving of recognition as equal in civil matters, with focus on the franchise. Getting the vote was the focal point for citizenship. Because of the passage of the 19th Amendment, the later movement did not focus on the vote as a marker of equality as a citizen. Instead it emphasized equal opportunity in economic and social areas and individual freedom.  2. Domestic sphere: The ideas of the women’s sphere, a culture of domesticity, and true womanhood are part of the middle-class foundation for women’s activism. This was a positive element for the earlier movement. In contrast, by the late 20th century these elements were considered part of the problem and were criticized and rejected by many if not most in the movement. For the early movement the two spheres defined how women could be equal to men. For the later movement the two spheres were considered responsible for keeping women less than equal to men.  3. Reproductive rights: For the early movement, abortion was legal and widely used but then broadly banned by 1860. For the later movement, abortion was illegal and not so widely used but then legalized by the Supreme Court’s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade. The earlier movement saw abortion change from a legal to an illegal practice. The later one saw abortion change from an illegal to a legal practice.   Women’s Rights Movement: 1840–1860  Background In early America, the working women of Lowell, Massachusetts, described themselves as “daughters of freemen,” thus edging toward defining a status for women as free and holders of natural rights.  In the early 19th century, owing to the widely present rule of coverture, married women were denied rights to own and manage property, to form contracts, to sue and be sued, and to exercise legal control over children. In addition, women were prohibited from voting or holding public office and denied access to higher education and the professions. Married women had no legal identity apart from their husbands. Divorced women could not gain custody of their children. Question 5 (continued)  However, by the 1840s a new conception of women was evolving. The revolutionary experience generated a form of national identity for women, that of the republican mother, which emphasized that women should provide cultural companionship and raise virtuous, responsible children with republican virtues, striving for education and independence of thought. The market revolution of the 1830s then added the doctrine of separate spheres. The reality of the new dynamic of work and trade was an increasing division between the working lives of men and women. In the separate spheres, as work moved away from home, men went out to work in the world, and women remained in their sphere at home. Here they became the civilizers and guardians of domestic culture and republican morality. Within the home women fulfilled what historians have called the “cult of domesticity” or the “cult of true womanhood.” These spheres and cultural identities became prominent in novels, magazines, paintings, and advice literature. An additional aspect of this change was an expanded definition of marriage from an obligation of society and economy to a cultural and nurturing experience of adults that defined positive roles for men and women within a home dedicated to moral, cultural, and educational endeavors. These characteristics were primarily limited to the emerging middle class — to women and families that were fortunate enough to accommodate two separate spheres of both a work life and a home life.  Activism  Early feminism first emerged within the abolitionist movement. In moral reform, women were men’s peers. The central act of moral suasion — personal conversion — was not limited to either gender. Addressing the domination and discrimination of slavery resulted in some women’s discovering a common purpose that drove them to make women’s rights a separate cause. Experience acquired in a range of reform activities provided invaluable skills for women to take up the cause of their own rights.  Actions and efforts raised consciousness of married women active in the reform movement. For middle-class women, who now had leisure time for reading, charitable activities, and socializing, a distinctly feminine subculture emphasizing “sisterhood” or “sorority” emerged.  Exercising their rights within their roles as moral peers of men, women engaged in a wide array of moral reform causes that extended beyond abolitionism to include such topics as prison reform, temperance, school reform, mental health reform, reform of women’s economic rights, and even suffrage.  Within the area of suffrage and electoral matters women found themselves quickly reduced to second-class status. In 1840 the refusal to seat female delegates from the United States at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London transformed the discontent of women into a self-conscious movement. Two of the excluded delegates were Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.  Over the following decade women reformers were active in speaking publicly, writing essays and scholarly works, organizing reform societies, and confronting legal and political bodies to bring moral reform and expand the rights of women. In 1833 The Advocate of Moral Reform appeared as the first female-edited, written, and typeset publication in the United States. Sarah Grimké produced Letters on Equality of the Sexes and the Condition of Women in 1837, and Margaret Fuller authored the essay “Woman in the Nineteenth Century” in 1845. The movement reached its high point with the famous Seneca Falls convention in 1848.  Organized by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and Susan B. Anthony, nearly 300 men and women gathered at Seneca Falls, New York, over July 19 and 20. Elizabeth Cady Stanton drafted 11 resolutions and a Declaration of Sentiments, making the argument that women had a natural right to equality in all Question 5 (continued)  spheres. The ninth resolution made the radical assertion that it was the duty of women to secure the right to vote.  Other reformers of the era included Lydia Maria Child, a writer, abolitionist, and moral reformer; Maria Stewart, a charismatic black Boston preacher who denounced racial and gender prejudice; Sarah and Angelina Grimké, sisters from South Carolina who moved to Philadelphia to support abolitionism; and Dorothea Dix of Boston, who argued for prison reform and better treatment of the mentally ill.  Outcome and Effect Women’s moral reform efforts were effective and had an impact. In addition to the broad effect of the abolition movement, which undermined the rationale for slavery, reformers successfully addressed state legislatures, saw penitentiaries created and health-care reforms enacted, published papers and books, and saw the reform of married women’s economic rights via such legislation as the New York Married Women’s Property Act. Most significant, the efforts made in the 1840s–1860s laid the foundation for further efforts at reform in the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Critics Critics of the leading women reformers disparaged them for crossing outside the spheres and for taking up the roles of men. Clergy attacked the Grimké sisters for assuming masculine tones. Within the abolition movement, Arthur Tappan resigned as president of the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1840 over the group’s support for women’s suffrage and feminism. Women’s rights figured centrally in the 1840 split of the American Anti-Slavery Society, in which opponents rejected the role of women activists and were concerned that they could embarrass the abolition movement.  Catherine Beecher, who authored the Treatise on Domestic Economy in 1841, argued that women should accept the limits of the women’s sphere of marriage and home and not be tempted to overstep those bounds.  Childbearing/abortion Some moral reformers were concerned about sexual excesses. Sylvester Graham was a well-known temperance lecturer who warned of sexual tensions and excess and advocated diet and physical restraint to ameliorate them. Part of his diet was a cracker that would later become known as the Graham cracker.   The birth rate fell from 1800 to 1860. Accompanying this decline was the expansion of abortion. Surgical abortions were widely used after 1830. One of every four pregnancies was aborted from 1840 to 1860. This rising rate prompted the first bans on the practice. By 1860, 20 of the 33 states had outlawed abortion.  Women’s Rights Movement: 1960–1980  Background In the 1950s increasing numbers of women went to college and worked outside home but were not expected to pursue long-term careers. Instead they were expected to devote themselves to family and home. A double standard of sexual behavior prevailed. In her book The Feminine Mystique, Betty Friedan called the American home “a comfortable concentration camp.”  In 1960 an oral contraceptive — widely referred to as “the pill” — was approved for use. It had been introduced in 1957 as Enovid, a medication for menstrual disorders. However, despite the pill, by the Question 5 (continued)  1960s illegal abortions were common, and approximately 200 women a year died as result of the procedures.  Over the next 20 years the nature of the average family would change dramatically. In the 1950s more than 70 percent of American families with children had a father who worked and a mother who stayed home. By 1980 only 15 percent of families were configured that way.  Activism Middle-class women in particular, influenced by the civil rights movement, begin to question their own second-class status. They initially did not challenge male sexism or careerism but wanted opportunities for women too. White, middle-class women in the political mainstream provided most of the national leadership and much of the constituency for the new feminism.  Betty Friedan’s 1963 book The Feminine Mystique identified “the problem that has no name” as the frustration of educated middle-class wives and mothers who had subordinated their own aspirations to the needs of men. Three issues initially predominated: equal treatment at school and work, an equal rights amendment, and abortion rights.  Equal Treatment The Presidential Commission on the Status of Women in 1961 led to the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and President John F. Kennedy’s banning of sex discrimination in federal employment. In 1964, in congressional debates over Title VII of 1964 Civil Rights Act, conservatives added an amendment to include gender, hoping it would kill the bill, but the amendment and full bill passed. Although future National Organization for Women (NOW) founders Aileen Hernandez and Richard Graham fought hard as members of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to enforce Title VII’s prohibition on sex discrimination, they were ultimately outnumbered 3–2, and the EEOC decided in September 1965 that sex segregation in job advertising was permissible. A month later, at a conference on Title VII and the EEOC, Dr. Pauli Murray — a law professor at Yale and a member of the President’s Commission on the Status of Women — denounced the EEOC and its stance permitting segregated job advertising. Betty Friedan immediately contacted Dr. Murray, one of many historic link-ups that led to a reemergence of the feminist movement in the United States.  The National Organization for Women was founded in 1966. NOW membership grew from 300 in 1966 to 15,000 by 1970. NOW later sued the EEOC for not upholding Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and sued 1,300 corporations for gender discrimination.  At first NOW did not focus on issues inside the private sphere of the home. The shift to the view that, according to one slogan, “the personal is political” came from younger women who had been active in civil rights. One issue was labeling, and they adopted the title “Ms.” as an equal title with “Mr.,” which does not reveal one’s marital status.  Younger feminists in 1967 and 1968 agreed with NOW’s challenge to discrimination in the public sphere, but they focused even more on the personal politics of women’s daily lives, on issues such as parenting, child care, housework, and abortion. Radical feminists Ti-Grace Atkinson and Susan Brownmiller attacked the family and home and denounced sexual intercourse with men as male domination. Question 5 (continued)  A variety of different trends emerged among feminists. Liberal feminists tended to focus on public issues and to work within the system. More radical elements of the women’s liberation movement emphasized the notion that “sisterhood is powerful.” These radical feminists blamed capitalism and men for discrimination against women. They rejected collaboration with men, insisting that women were superior and should create their own institutions. In 1968 militant feminists adopted “consciousness raising” as a recruitment device and a means of transforming women’s perceptions of themselves and society. They saw sharing personal problems as a first step toward defining social problems and achieving political solutions.  ERA  In 1972 Congress passed the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) and sent it to states for ratification. The ERA declares, “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State on account of sex.” Ultimately 35 states ratified the ERA, but it fell three short of the needed 38 (three-quarters of the total). The same year Phyllis Schlafly organized a campaign called “Stop the ERA.” This effort, and that of her later group, the Eagle Forum, succeeded in changing the debate about ERA from the goal of giving women equality to concerns about taking away their protections. Efforts to ratify the ERA continued until June 1982 when the window for ratification ran out without the necessary state support.  Abortion The case known as Roe v. Wade involved a Texas law outlawing abortions. The litigants argued that individuals’ “personal privacy zone” includes reproductive rights. The case was heard twice by the United States Supreme Court, once on December 13, 1971, then again on October 10, 1972. The Court rendered a 7–2 decision on January 22, 1973, which made a woman’s right to choose an abortion legal. Despite many subsequent challenges by the “Right to Life” movement, the Supreme Court continued to support the basic right.  The public is divided over support for abortion rights. The issue partly involved the use of federal tax money. In 1978 Congress passed the Hyde Amendment, which prohibited the use of Medicaid funds for abortions, except when the life of the mother was at risk.  Overall Outcome and Effect At the level of cities and states, the women’s rights movement contributed to domestic violence reforms, homes for battered women, and improved treatment for rape victims. The movement also had a significant educational impact. Feminist bookstores and publishing companies, such as the Feminist Press, reached out to readers. By the early 1970s college activists were demanding women’s studies programs and women’s centers. Between 1970 and 1975 as many as 150 women’s studies programs were established. By 1980 nearly 30,000 women’s studies courses were being offered. In the 1970s  no-fault divorce laws began in California. Day-care centers become commonplace. By 1983 women constituted half of the paid workforce, and during the decade of the 1980s the majority of the new jobs created were filled by women.  By 1970 women earned 41 percent of all BA degrees, compared with only 25 percent in 1950. Women working outside of home jumped from 20 million in 1960 to 60 million by 1990. Between 1970 and 2000 women’s share of law degrees shot up from 5 percent to nearly 50 percent, and the proportion of medical degrees awarded to women increased from less than 10 percent to more than 35 percent. By 1980,  30 percent of participants in intercollegiate sports were women, compared with 15 percent a decade earlier.  Question 5 (continued)  By the 1990s women held more than 10 percent of the seats in Congress and more than 20 percent of all state executive offices and state legislative seats. After 1992 there were a record 53 women in Congress. In 1981 President Reagan appointed Jeane Kirkpatrick as U.S. Representative to the United Nations and named Sandra Day O’Connor to the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1993 President Clinton appointed Janet Reno to be attorney general, and in 1997 Clinton named Madeleine Albright as secretary of state.  Reaction and Rejection Many conservative organizations blamed the philosophy behind the ERA for destroying American values and the family. In 1970 Vice President Spiro Agnew asserted, “Three things have been difficult to tame. The ocean, fools, and women. We may soon be able to tame the ocean, but fools and women may take a little longer.” In 1982 Connie Marshner, a Republican activist, declared, “Feminists praise self-centeredness and call it liberation.” Some women experienced the path of Dorothy Burlage, a conservative southern Baptist woman at the University of Texas who was influenced by “liberal Christian existentialism.” Between 1962 and 1970 she first joined the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and then the Students for Democratic Society (SDS) but then became disillusioned and quit.  The 1980s have come to be defined by many as the “postfeminist” era. One of the indicators of the conservative resurgence in the 1980s was its capture of the Republican Party’s position on women’s rights.
