Butler, report to the secretary of war, July 30, 1861. In the village of Hampton there were a large number of Negroes, composed in a great measure of women and children who had fled thither within my lines for protection, who had escaped from marauding Rebels who had been gathering up able-bodied blacks to aid them in constructing their batteries on the James and York rivers . . .  First, what shall be done with them? Second, what is their state and condition? Upon these questions I desire the instruction of the department. . . . Are these men, women, and children slaves? Are they free? Is their condition that of men, women, and children, or of property, or is it a mixed relation? What has been the effect of rebellion and a state of war on their status? When I adopted the theory of treating the able-bodied Negro fit to work in the trenches as property liable to be used in aid of rebellion, and so contraband of war, that condition of things was insofar met, as I then and still believe, on a legal and constitutional basis. Document Summary: Early in the Civil War, Union general Benjamin Butler wrote to Secretary of War Simon Cameron on the chaotic conditions he found in Virginia. Butler reported that many desperate enslaved African Americans sought protection from Confederates who wanted to force them to build river fortifications. These freedom seekers forced Butler and the Lincoln administration to decide whether fugitive slaves entering Union lines would be returned to their “owners” in accordance with the law or taken into custody, with the government assuming a degree of responsibility for their welfare. Butler’s own answer was that these freedom seekers were “contraband of war” who could serve the Union army in useful capacities, such as digging trenches. This document thus points to the pressure that Union forces faced in handling the many escaped slaves who came their way and the temptation to make strategic use of this suddenly available labor source. Other Union generals would have similar questions about freedom seekers and would handle the question of enslavement to their advantage, at least until President Abraham Lincoln made abundantly clear who held the powers of commander-in-chief. Document Information: • Slaves had fled to Union lines. • There is no Union policy on fleeing slaves. • Butler advances his theory on contraband of war. • Union army is using fugitive slave labor. Document Inferences: • Many slaves fled the slave-holding South as Union troops approached. • Enslaved African men, women, and children’s actions were compelling the federal government to confront slavery. • Foreshadows Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation. Question 1 Document Information and Inferences (continued) DOCUMENT A (continued) Potential Outside Information Triggered by Document: Confiscation Acts      Hunter, David Emancipation Proclamation Lincoln initially refused to accept Fort Monroe slaves as contraband Frémont’s edict      McClellan, George fugitive slaves/freedom seekers AP® UNITED STATES HISTORY 2009 SCORING GUIDELINES (Form B) Question 1 Document Information and Inferences (continued) DOCUMENT B Source: Resolution of African Americans in Newtown, New York, August 20, 1862. We, THE COLORED CITIZENS of Queens County, N.Y., having met in mass meeting . . . to consider the speech of Abraham Lincoln, . . . [wish] to express our views on the subject of being colonized in Central America or some other country. . . . While bleeding and struggling for her life against slaveholding traitors, and, at this very time, when our country is struggling for life and 1 million freemen are believed to be scarcely sufficient to meet the foe, we are called upon by the President of the United States to leave this land and go to another country, to carry out his favorite scheme of colonization. But at this crisis, we feel disposed to refuse the offers of the President, since the call of our suffering country is too loud and imperative to be unheeded. Document Summary: A group of African Americans met during the Civil War to consider President Abraham Lincoln’s proposal for Black resettlement in a foreign land, particularly the Caribbean or Latin America. These “colored citizens” from New York dismissed the idea of colonization out of hand. The burden of fighting all-out war, this group observed, was so great that even a million White soldiers might not carry the day. Under such trying circumstances, the very idea of removing Black citizens through colonization was unthinkable. This letter did not persuade the president. Although Lincoln did not think colonizing millions of African Americans was possible, he remained convinced that the profound differences between the White and Black races made such resettlement desirable. Document Information: • There are one million free Black American citizens. • There was a mass meeting of African Americans to rebut President Lincoln’s call for colonization of Blacks in Central America. Document Inferences: • African Americans wished to serve in the military. • The Union was going to have to pursue some other solution to race besides colonization. • Lincoln rejected a truly multicultural society. • Free Blacks were loyal, contributing citizens; colonization wasted contributions from Black citizens. Potential Outside Information Triggered by Document: American Colonization Society Greeley, Horace Liberia Lincoln’s plan for compensated emancipation in border states “The Prayer of the Twenty Millions” AP® UNITED STATES HISTORY 2009 SCORING GUIDELINES (Form B) Question 1 Document Information and Inferences (continued) DOCUMENT C Source: Abraham Lincoln, a published letter, August 26, 1863. There are those who are dissatisfied with me . . . to be plain, you are dissatisfied with me about the negro.

You say you will not fight to free negroes. Some of them seem willing to fight for you; but, no matter . . . negroes, like other people, act upon motives. Why should they do anything for us, if we will do nothing for them? If they stake their lives for us, they must be prompted by the strongest motive—even the promise of freedom. And the promise being made, must be kept. Document Summary: Here, President Abraham Lincoln responded to a White letter-writer, apparently from the North, who opposed equality for African Americans. While Lincoln realized his racial views were not universally popular, he wondered why the letter-writer would not support freedom for African Americans when they had expressed a willingness to fight for Whites in the Civil War. In any case, Lincoln observed that freedom had been promised to African Americans and that he intended to honor that commitment. Less than a month after this letter appeared, Lincoln issued a carefully worded proclamation declaring the freedom of enslaved Africans in Confederate territory. Document Information: • Lincoln has decided what to do about slavery. • Lincoln intends to free the slaves. • Lincoln’s views on slavery are controversial. • Lincoln intends to remain steadfast in his plans for emancipation. Document Inferences: • Lincoln’s views on slavery were evolving. • Black soldiers were fighting for the Union and their own freedom, e.g., Fort Wagner. • Confederates did not follow the rules of war in treating Black soldiers. • The Civil War will recast the American South. • Lincoln recognized qualities in African Americans that he had not previously recognized. Potential Outside Information Triggered by Document: Antietam      Lincoln’s Preliminary Emancipation The Crater Proclamation Crittenden Resolution      Militia Act of 1862 Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts Regiment New Market Heights (Chaffin’s Farm) Glory AP® UNITED STATES HISTORY 2009 SCORING GUIDELINES (Form B) Question 1 Document Information and Inferences (continued) DOCUMENT D Source: Republican Party platform, 1864. . . . 3.

With the stakes so high, Republicans urged passage of a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery permanently. The Republican Party had come some distance in its thinking about slavery since its previous platform had been promulgated. In 1860 the Republicans believed that slavery would gradually die out if it was kept from spreading like cancer to the territories; in 1864 the Republicans could no longer tolerate human bondage and sought to end it everywhere with a single stroke of the constitutional pen. Another objective of the 1864 Republican platform was to afford all races who fought for the Union every available protection, an apparent reference to African American troops who were sometimes mutilated or massacred in combat. Document Information: • Republican Party identifies slavery as the cause of the Civil War. • Republican Party calls for the elimination of slavery. Document Inferences: • Fundamental shift in Republican Party’s position on slavery, i.e., no slave extension. • African American troops were being mistreated, if not massacred. • Democrats were responsible for the Civil War. • Serious challenge by the Peace Democrats, i.e., George McClellan. Potential Outside Information Triggered by Document: African Americans serve in the military Johnson, Andrew Copperheads       Quantrill, William Douglass, Frederick      Thirteenth Amendment Forrest, Nathan Bedford     Union Party Fort Pillow Massacre      Wade–Davis Bill General Order 233 AP® UNITED STATES HISTORY 2009 SCORING GUIDELINES (Form B) Question 1 Document Information and Inferences (continued) DOCUMENT E Source: Charlotte Forten, African American teacher in the South Carolina Sea Islands, March 1864. I never before saw children so eager to learn, although I had had several years’ experience in New England schools. Coming to school is a constant delight and recreation to them. They come here as other children go to play. The older ones, during the summer, work in the fields from early morning until eleven or twelve o’clock, and then come to school, after their hard toil in the hot sun, as bright and as anxious to learn as ever. . . . Many of the grown people are desirous of learning to read. It is wonderful how a people who have been so long crushed to the earth . . . can have so great a desire for knowledge, and such a capacity for attaining it. Document Summary: Charlotte Forten, who came from a prominent abolitionist family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was the first northern Black teacher to instruct former slaves in the South in 1862. In what was later called the Port Royal Experiment on St. Helena Island, South Carolina, the cultured, idealistic, and driven 24-year-old Forten was amazed by the hunger for learning that African American children and adults exhibited. Their thirst for an education was not slowed by youthful distractions, grueling field work under a hot sun, or a lifetime of oppression. Forten stayed on the island for 18 months, hoping she would form a bond with her students, but her precarious health broke first. In truth, Forten’s upbringing, education, and temperament gave her more in common with White teachers who worked alongside her than with her unsophisticated and unlettered students, whose first language was Gullah. Forten later wrote about her memorable experience in a series of essays entitled “Life on the Sea Islands” that appeared in the Atlantic Monthly. Document Information: • New England women, including African Americans, went to the South to teach formerly enslaved African children how to read. • African Americans of all ages were eager to learn. Document Inferences: • African American northerners contributed to the African American community generally. • The initial optimism of the Port Royal Experiment would turn sour, eliciting fierce White opposition. • African Americans tried to dismiss the myths of slavery. Potential Outside Information Triggered by Document: abolitionists       Freedmen’s Savings Bank American Missionary Association    Hampton Institute Armstrong, Samuel Chapman Port Royal Experiment Edisto Island, South Carolina Sherman’s Special Field Orders No. 15 Fisk University       Sherman, Thomas “40 acres and a mule” St. Helena Island, South Carolina Freedmen’s Bureau AP® UNITED STATES HISTORY 2009 SCORING GUIDELINES (Form B) Question 1 Document Information and Inferences (continued) DOCUMENT F Source: The New York Times, March 7, 1864. There has been no more striking manifestation of the marvelous times that are upon us than the scene in our streets at the departure of the first of our colored regiments. . . . Eight months ago the African race in this City were literally hunted down like wild beasts. They fled for their lives. When caught, they were shot down in cold blood, or stoned to death, or hung to the trees or the lamp-posts. Their houses were pillaged; the asylum which Christian charity had provided for their orphaned children was burned . . . How astonishingly has all this been changed! The same [African American] men . . . now march in solid platoons, with shouldered muskets, slung knapsacks, and buckled cartridge-boxes down through our gayest avenues and our busiest thoroughfares to the pealing strains of martial music, and are everywhere saluted with waving handkerchiefs, with descending flowers, and with the acclamations and plaudits of countless beholders. It is only by such occasions that we can at all realize the prodigious revolution which the public mind everywhere is experiencing. Such developments are infallible tokens of a new epoch. Document Summary: This article/editorial marvels at the rapid acceptance that African Americans received in New York City during the Civil War. In July 1863, after a military draft was announced to support the Union effort to crush the Confederate rebellion, White urban residents, particularly Irish Americans, went on a racist rampage to kill any Black person they encountered. To many Whites, not only were Blacks the main reason the war was being fought, but they were stealing blue-collar jobs away from White workers. Eight months later, however, Black troops, looking smart in their new uniforms and with their erect military posture, were greeted by admiring crowds of White well-wishers. Such a dramatic change in attitude in such a short time, the newspaper wrote, offered indisputable proof of a social revolution. Document Information: • White society’s views about Blacks had changed. • Racial violence over the war. • African American troops. Document Inferences: • The Civil War was now for social change. • African Americans were greatly appreciated. • African American military service promoted this change. • Blacks were willing to fight in the war despite mistreatment/riots. • The Union would win, and winning meant defining the society. Question 1 Document Information and Inferences (continued) DOCUMENT F (continued) Potential Outside Information Triggered by Document: Banks, Nathaniel       Higginson, Thomas Wentworth  Bowser, Mary Elizabeth      Island Mound  Carney, William      Louisiana Native Guard  Dalton Conference       Milliken’s Bend  Delany, Martin        New York City draft riots  Fifteenth Amendment       Poison Spring  Fifty-fourth Massachusetts Regiment  Port Hudson  First and Second South Carolina Volunteers  Shaw, Robert Gould  First Kansas Colored Volunteers  Smalls, Robert  Fort Wagner        Tubman, Harriet  Fourteenth Amendment      U.S. Colored Troops  Gettysburg Address       Walker, William  Glory  AP® UNITED STATES HISTORY 2009 SCORING GUIDELINES (Form B) Question 1 Document Information and Inferences (continued) DOCUMENT G AP® UNITED STATES HISTORY 2009 SCORING GUIDELINES (Form B) Question 1 Document Information and Inferences (continued) DOCUMENT G (continued) Document Summary: A Thomas Nast cartoon that depicts Lady Liberty in a chamber bedecked with United States flags, pointing to an African American soldier who has lost a leg and is on crutches.

We claim the right of suffrage . . . Document Summary: Meeting a few months after the Civil War ended, African Americans in Virginia made an impassioned plea for suffrage. This inalienable right, the convention maintained, is guaranteed to all free men, including Black men, through the Declaration of Independence. This limited excerpt does not include some important elements of the document, including that the delegates were former slaves whose great fear was that former Confederates were recovering their citizenship rights before African Americans ever got theirs. Maintaining that ex-Confederates possessed a loyalty that was no more than “lip deep,” the Black delegates warned of their vulnerability in being “sheep in the midst of wolves.” Only the armed might of the United States government, the former slaves insisted, prevented Blacks from being driven from the land they had lived and worked on all their lives. Ultimately, Black pressure from such groups as this one in Alexandria, helped win ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments to the United States Constitution, guaranteeing equal protection before the law and Black male suffrage. Document Information: • Black southerners met to demand equality. • Black people call themselves “citizens.” • Black people view the franchise as a means to achieve equal rights. • Black people apply the Declaration of Independence. Document Inferences: • Black people did not have equal rights. • Black people were part of the Reconstruction process. Potential Outside Information Triggered by Document: Civil Rights Act of 1866 Knights of the White Camellia Fifteenth Amendment      Ku Klux Klan Fourteenth Amendment     Radical Republicans Gettysburg Address race riots in Memphis and New Orleans AP® UNITED STATES HISTORY 2009 SCORING GUIDELINES (Form B) Question 1 Document Information and Inferences (continued) DOCUMENT I Source: Affidavit of Rebecca Parsons, former slave, 1867 (given to a Freedmen’s Bureau agent). Before me came Rebecca Parsons—a freedwoman . . . she was . . . a Slave of T.

the highest proportional volume of immigration in U.S. history • No fewer than 4.2 million immigrants over 1840–1860, and 3 million arrived between 1845 and 1855. • About four in five of the 4.2 million immigrants from all nations who arrived from 1840 to 1860 settled in the New England and mid-Atlantic states. • No federal legislation regulating immigration. • New York, Chicago, and San Francisco were half immigrant; St. Louis was three-fifths immigrant in this period. • Irish immigrants: o Approximately 50,000 in the United States in 1830s. o Great Famine of 1845–1851: Irish potato famine brought Irish immigrants. o 1840–1860: two million Irish men and women came into the United States. o Primarily settled in northeastern cities. o Avoided South because they opposed slavery, shunned Blacks, or feared competition from slave labor. o Characterized as “lawless and disruptive. In Ireland they had become accustomed to think of the law as a weapon of their enemy, the English landowners, and they brought this attitude to America. To the Irish, flouting the law was a manly activity” (Kelley, Shaping of the American Past). o Characterized as “tenaciously nationalistic and bitterly anti-British” (Faragher, Out of Many). o Faced not only employment discrimination but also persistent cultural denigration. It was common for newspapers of the time to caricature the Irish as monkeys, similar to the way cartoonists portrayed African Americans. Tensions over Immigration • 1834: Charlestown, Massachusetts, riot between Catholic and Protestant workers. • 1844: Anti-Catholic riots in Philadelphia. Governor called out militia to protect Catholics after Catholic bishop persuaded public school officials to use both bibles. Incited by Native American Clubs. Lasted two months; two Catholic churches burned, 13 citizens killed, and 50 wounded. • 1855: Riots in St. Louis, Baltimore, and Louisville showed streaks of nativism in South. • 1855: “Lager Beer Riots” in Chicago over closing saloons on Sundays. Irish, Germans, and Swedes fought militia; ended with imposition of martial law. Question 3 Information List (continued) • In Cincinnati from 1846 to 1853, crime rate reportedly tripled. Murder reportedly up sevenfold. In Boston, expenditures for poor relief up three times over same period. • New York City in 1860, 55 percent of those arrested for crimes were reportedly Irish. Political Tensions • Irish network of institutions: charitable societies, orphanages, militia companies, parochial schools, social clubs, and political organizations. Maintained identity and attained considerable political power. • Fraternal lodges based on ethnicity included Irish Ancient Order of Hibernians. • Foreign-born Boston voters (mostly Irish) increased 200 percent from 1850 to 1855. • Cartoons of German beer kegs and Irish whiskey kegs stealing elections. • Samuel F. B. Morse, author of Foreign Conspiracy against the Liberties of the United States (1834), argued Catholicism was a threat to the republic. Advocated an “Anti-Popery Union.” Republican-minded Protestants used this book in Sunday school. • Pope Pius IX opposed republican reformers in Italy and called republicanism a false ideology based on sovereignty of people rather than sovereignty of God. • Pope Pius X (1846–1878) reacted against secular liberalism and European uprisings of 1848. • Catholic Archbishop John Hughes of New York attacked abolitionists, Free-Soilers, and Protestant reform movements as “Red Republicanism” of Europe. Hughes address (1850), “The Decline of Protestantism and Its Causes,” notes Catholic growth three times faster than Protestantism. “Protestantism is effete, powerless, dying out.” • Protestants called for restricting public offices for native-born Americans. • “Free School” political tickets created to defend public education. • The Native American Association founded in 1837; became the Native American Party in 1845. • Charles Allen organized the Order of Star-Spangled Banner in New York City in 1849. • American Party (Know-Nothings): o Two secret fraternal societies of native-born Protestants merged in 1852: the Order of the Star-Spangled Banner and the Order of United Americans. By 1854 elections they became the American Party, or Know-Nothings. The party captured votes of Whig Party members who were not yet Republicans. o Membership by 1854 was between 800,000 and 1.5 million. o Did well in New England in 1855. o In 1854 won complete control in Massachusetts, capturing governorship, most of legislature, and entire congressional delegation; also won elections in Maryland, Kentucky, and Tennessee and polled at least 45 percent of vote in five other southern states and 40 percent of Pennsylvania vote. o Presidential candidate in 1856, Millard Filmore, won 21 percent of popular vote and 8 electoral votes. o Declined for several reasons: Over 1855–56, noticeable decline in immigration; also conflict in Kansas, but most key was grassroots protest against professional politicians of Democrats and Whigs. Its spokesmen and elected officials were neither professional politicians nor established community leaders. Not able to make use of power. The Know-Nothings also did nothing. Voters looked elsewhere as issues changed. Question 3 Information List (continued) Economic Tensions • Poorest immigrants were peasants and laborers from Ireland, who fled famine in 1840s caused by severe overpopulation, potato blight. No resources to buy farms. • Immigrants settled in cities, taking low-skilled jobs in factories, construction, and labor, with long hours and low wages. Perceived as competition to others, edge to industrialists. In New York and Boston, formed nearly one-third of population by 1850. • Illnesses: o Cholera, yellow fever, typhoid, diphtheria, tuberculosis. o 1849 cholera epidemics in New York, St. Louis, Cincinnati; 5,000 died in New York. • Unemployed Protestant mechanics and poorly paid Protestant labor blamed immigrant labor; organized Native American Clubs. Called for extension of naturalization from 5 years to 21 years. • Many Protestant laborers felt closer to Protestant owners than to Catholic labor. • Catholic clergy and some Democrats in northeastern states wanted to reserve local taxes paid by Catholics for parochial schools. • 1852: first Plenary Council of American Bishops decided to seek tax support for Catholic schools or tax relief for parents. • Irish women were called “Biddies” (Bridgets) and Irish men “Paddies” (Patricks). • As Irish entered police departments in big cities, the term “Paddy wagon” emerged as name for the wagon that hauled criminals to jail. • Ethnic workers viewed temperance as business class meddling in their lives, while successful native-born workers tended to embrace the evangelical, middle-class ideology of temperance and self-help. Religious Tensions • 1820s: Second Great Awakening led by Evangelical Protestants. • 1825: Burned Over District in upstate New York. • Many Germans and most Irish were Catholic. • 1840s: 16 Catholic dioceses and 700 Catholic churches existed in United States; by 1860, this had grown to 45 dioceses and 3,000 churches. • 1840: Catholics ranked fifth in the United States in terms of members, behind the Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Congregationalists; by 1850, with some 1.8 million members, Catholics had the most members. • Catholics resented Protestant domination of public education and use of King James Bible. • Archbishop Hughes of New York City criticized public schools as purveyors of “Socialism, Red Republicanism, Universalism, Infidelity, Deism, Atheism, and Pantheism.” • Protestants thought parochial schools undermined public schools. • Evangelical ministers opposed Catholic theology. • Temperance advocates were alarmed by Irish drinking. • Beginning with Maine in 1851, 12 states enacted prohibition laws by 1855, and although many laws were weakened or repealed, they exacerbated tensions. • For the first time Americans encountered the unfamiliar sight of priests and nuns in black garments on their streets. They also experienced the newcomers’ relaxed “Continental Sunday,” which turned the sober Protestant Sabbath into an exuberant day of visiting, picnicking, playing, and imbibing. Question 3 Information List (continued) • Catholics tended to place less emphasis on individual independence and more on communities created by family and church. Archbishop John Hughes said man was not an autonomous creature but “by his nature a being of society.” Thus Hughes was hostile to Protestant reform impulses that sinning behavior could be overcome by individuals. • Authors posing as escaped nuns described secrets of the convents, including burial of babies. Maria Monk, Awful Disclosures (1836), sold 300,000 copies. Question 4 Explain the origins of TWO of the following third parties and evaluate their impact on United States politics and national policies. The People’s Party (Populists), 1892 The Progressive Party (Bull Moose Party), 1912 The States’ Rights Party (Dixiecrats), 1948 The American Independent Party, 1968 The 8–9 Essay • Contains a clear, well-developed thesis that explains the origins of two of the given third parties and evaluates their impact on United States politics and national policies. • Supports the thesis with substantial, relevant information that explains the origins of two third parties and their impact on United States politics and national policies. • Effectively analyzes the origins of two third parties and their impact on United States politics and national policies. • Is well organized and well written. • May contain minor errors that do not detract from the overall quality of the essay. The 5–7 Essay • Contains a thesis, which may be partially developed, that explains the origins of two of the given third parties and evaluates their impact on United States politics and national policies. • Provides some relevant information that explains the origins of two third parties and their impact on United States politics and national policies; coverage may be somewhat imbalanced. • Analyzes to some extent the origins of two third parties and their impact on United States politics and national policies. • Has acceptable organization and writing. • May contain errors that do not seriously detract from the essay. The 2–4 Essay • Presents a thesis that may be confused, simplistic, or undeveloped in terms of explaining the origins of two of the given third parties and evaluating their impact on United States politics and national policies. • Includes little relevant information concerning the origins of two third parties and their impact on United States politics and national policies; may treat only part of the question. • Contains little analysis of the origins of two third parties and their impact on United States politics and national policies. • May be poorly organized and/or poorly written. • May contain major errors. The 0–1 Essay • Lacks a thesis or restates the question. • Includes no relevant information concerning the origins of two of the given third parties and evaluating their impact on United States politics and national policies. • Contains no analysis of the origins of two third parties and their impact on United States politics and national policies. • Is poorly organized and/or poorly written. • May contain numerous errors, both major and minor. AP® UNITED STATES HISTORY 2009 SCORING GUIDELINES (Form B) Question 4 (continued) The — Essay • Is completely off topic or blank. Question 4 Information List People’s Party (Populists), 1892 Origins • Farmers established the Patrons of Husbandry (the Grange) in 1867 in response to abusive railroad rates and practices. Several states passed Granger laws in attempts at state regulation of railroads. These efforts were set back when the Supreme Court ruled (Wabash case) that states could not regulate interstate railroad traffic. The Interstate Commerce Commission was established in 1887, but it lacked enforcement power. • Between 1870 and 1890 American grain production grew three times as fast as the United States population. Farmers were dependent on rising exports. European agriculture was strengthening at the same time. World market prices for cotton and wheat fell about 60 percent from 1870 to 1895. Farmers blamed banks, railroads, and the monetary system. Many farmers supported the Greenback Party, which favored the issuance of more United States Treasury notes (greenbacks). • By 1890 farmers experiencing problems with credit and exploitative railroad rates had established the National Farmer’s Alliance and Industrial Union. It had a comprehensive political agenda, including (a) a graduated income tax; (b) direct election of United States senators; (c) free and unlimited coinage of silver at a ratio of 16 to 1; (d) effective government control and, if necessary, ownership of railroad, telegraph, and telephone companies; and (e) the establishment of “subtreasuries” for the storage of crops with government loans at 2 percent on those crops. • Anticipating that Republicans and many Democrats would resist these demands, by 1892 many members of the alliance were ready to create and join a third party. • The People’s Party’s first nominating convention took place in Omaha in July 1892. • The People’s Party platform called for unlimited coinage of silver at 16 to 1; creation of the subtreasury program for crop storage and farm loans; government ownership of railroad, telegraph, and telephone companies; a graduated income tax; direct election of senators; and laws to protect labor unions against prosecution for strikes and boycotts. Impact • The People’s Party won 22 electoral votes but only 9 percent of the popular vote for president in 1892. • The party made some gains because of the Panic of 1893. • When Congress repealed the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1893, the Democratic Party was divided. A faction that took free silver as its major issue gained strength and was in position to take over the party in 1896. This opened the possibility of an alliance with the People’s Party. • After William Jennings Bryan gave his “Cross of Gold” speech at the 1896 Democratic Party convention, the Democrats made him their nominee for president and caused turmoil in the People’s Party, which nominated Bryan as well. Republican William McKinley was elected president with 51.7 percent of the popular vote to 47.7 percent for Bryan. The Democrats had effectively stolen the Populists’ thunder. • The economy came out of depression in McKinley’s first year in office, and new gold fields were discovered in Alaska. The silver issue lost its importance with voters as deflation ended and farmers saw gains. Although Bryan ran against McKinley again in 1900, the election results were even more in McKinley’s favor. Question 4 Information List (continued) Progressive Party (Bull Moose Party), 1912 Origins • Progressives wanted to rid politics of corruption and tame the power of the “trusts.” They went after prostitution, gambling, drinking, and other vices. Progressives first appeared in city politics to oust crooked mayors and political machines. They went on to carry their message to state and national levels. They agreed on the need for an activist government to right what they perceived as wrongs. • When Republican Theodore Roosevelt succeeded assassinated William McKinley in 1901, he quickly showed his progressive credentials. His Justice Department used the Sherman Anti-Trust Act to dissolve the Northern Securities Company and sided with coal miners in their strike. • Roosevelt did not seek election in 1908 and passed the baton William Howard Taft. Taft upset progressives over his tariff policies and particularly during the Ballinger–Pinchot controversy. Roosevelt returned to politics in 1910. His followers did well in the 1910 congressional elections, and Roosevelt announced his candidacy for nomination for the 1912 presidential election. The conservative Republican old guard denied Roosevelt a convention victory, giving the nomination to Taft instead. • The day after Taft’s nomination, Roosevelt and his supporters withdrew from the Republican Party and put together the new Progressive Party. It promptly nominated Roosevelt for president. With the Republicans split between Taft and Roosevelt, Democrat Woodrow Wilson won the 1912 election for president. Impact • The Progressive Party split the Republican vote between old guard conservatives who favored Taft and progressives who supported Roosevelt. • Both Roosevelt and Wilson ran on reform platforms. The Progressive Party essentially handed Wilson and the Democrats the presidency. • This guaranteed a continuation of progressive policies. The Progressive Party passed from the national scene. The Republican Party healed its wounds and was competitive again in the 1916 presidential election. States’ Rights Party (Dixiecrats), 1948 Origins • President Truman had established a civil rights committee that issued a report calling for a federal antilynching law, a civil rights division within the Justice Department, desegregation of the military, and antidiscrimination efforts in employment, housing, and public facilities.  • Truman supported these recommendations in his 1948 presidential campaign. • In 1948 the Dixiecrats split from the Democratic Party behind the leadership of South Carolina’s segregationist congressman Strom Thurmond. Thurmond broke with the Democrats over Truman’s support for civil rights. Impact • Truman won the presidential election in 1948, and the States’ Rights Party carried four states. • The election showed that the segregation/race issue was strong enough to cause lifelong southern Democrats (the solid South) to desert the party. • Times were changing. In 1947 Jackie Robinson broke major league baseball’s color barrier. Question 4 Information List (continued) • Truman went on to support several civil rights initiatives, including an executive order to begin the desegregation of the military, and he supported Franklin Roosevelt’s Fair Employment Practices Commission in its efforts to end discrimination in federal hiring. American Independent Party, 1968 Origins • Governor George Wallace of Alabama was a well-known opponent of racial integration. In 1963 he had personally blocked Black students’ attempts to register at the University of Alabama, causing President Kennedy to federalize the Alabama National Guard. • In 1968 Wallace decided to seek national support as a third-party candidate and formed the American Independent Party. Wallace broke with the Democratic Party, as Thurmond had done, over the party’s support of civil rights, particularly the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. • In his campaign, Wallace spoke out against the counterculture and the anti–Vietnam War movement. Impact • In 1968 the American Independent Party picked up 46 electoral votes from five states in the deep South. • The American Independent Party’s electoral votes hurt the Democratic Party, and Republican Richard Nixon won the presidency. • Nixon too spoke out against the counterculture and the anti–Vietnam War movement, but he was not an opponent of civil rights. • An assassination attempt during the 1972 presidential campaign left Wallace crippled and unable to continue campaigning. Without its leader, the American Independent Party faded. • Alienated conservative Democrats shifted their support to the Republican Party over the next several years, forming a particularly strong conservative base in the Republican Party. Additional Relevant Information Populists People Bellamy, Edward Lease, Mary Elizabeth Bryan, William Jennings McKinley, William Cleveland, Grover Powderly, Terence Debs, Eugene Watson, Tom Donnelly, Ignatius Weaver, James  Hanna, Mark Willard, Francis Organizations Coxey’s Army Socialism Knights of Labor Southern Farmers’ Alliance National Agricultural Wheel Question 4 Information List (continued) Proposals/Legislation/Events Bland-Allison “Cross of Gold” Speech Democrats elections of 1892, 1896 Haymarket Riot Homestead Strike Looking Backward Concepts bi-metalism conservation direct election of senators free coinage of silver gold standard Progressives People Addams, Jane Beveridge, Albert Bryce, James  Croly, Herbert Debs, Eugene Dewey, John Johnson, Hiram Keller, Helen Publications The American Commonwealth The Jungle Organizations American Socialist Party Democratic Party Industrial Workers of the World Concepts Bull Moose child labor laws constitutional amending direct democracy (initiative, referendum, recall) eight-hour workday National Banking Act Omaha Convention Omaha Platform Panic of 1873 Pullman Strike Sherman Silver Purchase Act Woman’s Christian Temperance Union income tax regulatory state subtreasury system women’s suffrage Kelley, Florence LaFollette, Robert Munsey, Frank Perkins, George Pinchot, Gifford Roosevelt, Theodore Taft, William Howard Wilson, Woodrow The New Republic The Promise of American Life Republican Party Western Federation of Miners farm relief immigration restriction income tax inheritance tax insurgents Question 4 Information List (continued) limited use of the injunction monopoly muckraking New Nationalism presidential primary progressive education States’ Rights Party (Dixiecrats) Personalities Humphrey, Hubert Robinson, Jackie Thurmond, Strom Events/Publications/Concepts Berlin Airlift Cold War Fair Deal House Un-American Activities Committee  (HUAC) Iron Curtain Jim Crow integration of the United States military Marshall Plan American Independent Party People Goldwater, Barry Kennedy, Robert LeMay, Curtis McCarthy, Eugene Nixon, Richard Events/Organizations/Concepts assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert F.

Each party was a response to the inequities and social insecurities generated by unfettered industrial capitalism as well as the failure of the major parties to address those inequities and insecurities and point the way to a far more equitable society. Both Populists and Progressives anticipated the New Deal welfare state of the 1930s and began the political realignments that would be necessary for that welfare state to become a reality. Despite sharing a common vocabulary of reform, Populists and Progressives were divided by time and geography and dramatically different goals. Beginning in the heartland, the Populists hoped to create a true, mass-based political movement that, like the Socialists, sought to fundamentally change the nature of United States society. The Progressives, by contrast advocated social-welfare legislation and an activist state in the hope that radical change would be avoided. The Bull Moose Party’s “New Nationalism” aimed to save American capitalism by reforming it. Their differences aside, the People’s Party and the Progressive Party sketched the contours of what would eventually become twentieth-century liberalism. States’ Rights Party and American Independent Party If the Populists and the Bull Moosers foreshadowed the New Deal welfare state, the Dixiecrats and the followers of George Wallace prophesized its demise. The States’ Rights Party of 1948 and the American Independent Party of 1968 pioneered the transition of the South from the Democratic to the Republican Party and helped birth the conservative movement that would eventually push the Republican Party to the far right. Defying their traditional conservatism, southern states embraced much of the New Deal largely because of the federal dollars it pumped into the region. After World War II when the bread-and-butter economics of the New Deal expanded to include civil rights, the South bolted, joining with others to rein in the reach of the federal government and stifle any furthering of the liberal agenda. Southern bigots linked arms with groups such as the American Medical Association to defeat President Truman’s health care proposals, fearing that a national health program would result in integrated hospitals and the end of Jim Crow. Despite its lack of electoral success in 1948, the States’ Rights Party made the first crack in the New Deal coalition. The American Independent Party would make the second. Forged in the crucible of the tumultuous 1960s, the American Independent Party used the momentum of Barry Goldwater’s pro–states’ rights presidential campaign and the backlash against the Great Society and the Warren Court to create a political appeal that would bind upper- and lower-class whites in opposition to government and pave the way for the conservative resurgence of the 1970s and 1980s.  Casting himself as a latter-day champion of the forgotten man, George Wallace fashioned a new political message. In place of the traditional populist campaigns that cast the rich and big business as social oppressors, Wallace instead attacked liberalism and the Democratic Party establishment. Insisting that the Democrats were using taxes to transfer wealth from hard-working Whites to undeserving Blacks, Wallace laid the groundwork for the antitax movement of the 1970s. By linking taxes with race, Wallace also paved the way for the “southern strategy” of Richard Nixon that would result in Republican control of the former Confederacy and the conservative movement that marked the remainder of the twentieth century.  Question 5 Analyze the ways in which the events and trends of the 1970s diminished the nation’s economic power and international influence, and challenged Americans’ confidence in both. The 8–9 Essay • Contains a clear, well-developed thesis that assesses the ways in which the events and trends of the 1970s diminished the nation’s economic power and international influence, and challenged Americans’ confidence in both. • Supports the thesis with substantial, relevant information concerning the ways in which the events and trends of the 1970s diminished the nation’s economic power and international influence, and challenged Americans’ confidence in both. • Effectively analyzes the ways in which events and trends of the 1970s diminished the nation’s economic power and international influence, and challenged Americans’ confidence in both. • Provides coverage that may be somewhat uneven. • Is well organized and well written. • May contain minor errors. The 5–7 Essay • Contains a thesis, which may be partially developed, assessing the ways in which the events and trends of the 1970s diminished the nation’s economic power and international influence, and challenged Americans’ confidence in both. • Provides some relevant information detailing the ways in which the events and trends of the 1970s diminished the nation’s economic power and international influence, and challenged Americans’ confidence in both. • Analyzes to some degree the ways in which events and trends of the 1970s diminished the nation’s economic power and international influence, and challenged Americans’ confidence in them. • Provides coverage that may be unbalanced. • Has acceptable organization and writing. • May contain errors that do not seriously detract from the essay. The 2–4 Essay • Presents a thesis that may be confused, simplistic, or undeveloped in terms of assessing the ways in which the events and trends of the 1970s diminished the nation’s economic power and international influence, and challenged Americans’ confidence in both. • Includes little relevant information concerning the ways in which the events and trends of the 1970s diminished the nation’s economic power and international influence, and challenged Americans’ confidence in both. • Contains little analysis of the ways in which events and trends of the 1970s diminished the nation’s economic power and international influence, and challenged Americans’ confidence in both. • May address only part of the question. • May be poorly organized and/or poorly written. • May contain major errors. Question 5 (continued) The 0–1 Essay • Lacks a thesis or restates the question. • Includes no relevant information detailing the ways in which the events and trends of the 1970s diminished the nation’s economic power and international influence, and challenged Americans’ confidence in both. • Contains no analysis of the ways in which events and trends of the 1970s diminished the nation’s economic power and international influence, and challenged Americans’ confidence in both. • Is poorly organized and/or poorly written. • May contain numerous errors, both major and minor. The — Essay • Is completely off topic or blank. Question 5 Information List People Agnew, Spiro Carter, Jimmy Dean, John Ehrlichman, John Ellsberg, Daniel Ervin, Sam Ford, Gerald Haldeman, H.

The Federal Reserve Board permitted the money supply to grow. These measures drove price inflation. • In 1971 unemployment grew to 6 percent and the United States ran its first ever trade deficit. The trade deficit undermined the value of the American dollar by enabling foreign banks to exchange U.S. dollars for gold at highly favorable rates. The United States floated the dollar against the prevailing market price of gold and against other currencies. • Facing continued high unemployment and inflation, the Nixon administration in 1973 devalued the dollar. Little impact was seen on the trade deficit, as over the next decade U.S. exports more than tripled but imports more than quadrupled. • In 1974 President Ford introduced “Whip Inflation Now,” or WIN. Stagflation continued as both prices and inflation rose. Unemployment reached 8.5 percent, and inflation topped 9 percent. Question 5 Information List (continued) • Ever-rising international oil prices triggered a series of gasoline and home heating fuel price increases that rippled through the economy. With Middle East oil prices soaring, newly elected President Carter went on national TV pitching a complicated energy proposal without having first consulted the congressional leadership. Congress quickly rejected the plan. • New York City needed federal loan guarantees to avoid bankruptcy. • The Carter administration had no answers for stagflation. By 1980 the economy had stopped expanding, inflation topped 13 percent, and unemployment (which had dropped below 6 percent in 1979) was rising again. • Inflation and high interest rates choked off productivity and economic growth. International Events and Trends • In the spring of 1970 U.S. military incursions into ostensibly neutral Cambodia became public knowledge, and student unrest broke out on college campuses. National Guard troops fired on demonstrators, killing four students at Kent State University. Police fatally shot two students at Jackson State University. • Daniel Ellsberg leaked the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times. Installments from the papers began running daily in the Times. The Nixon administration was unsuccessful in getting a Supreme Court injunction to stop publication of the classified documents. • There was a break-in in June 1972 at the Democratic Party National Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel. • In January 1973 the United States and North Vietnam signed peace accords requiring the United States to remove its forces from Vietnam, bringing agreement on the return of prisoners of war, and permitting North Vietnam to keep its forces in South Vietnam. • In May 1973 John Dean testified before the Senate Watergate Committee and linked President Nixon to the coverup of the Watergate break-in. The Senate and the public learn that President Nixon taped his conversations in the Oval Office. • In July 1974 the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Nixon’s claim of “executive privilege” over the release of the Watergate tapes was not justified. Nixon had to release the tapes. • In August 1974 Nixon resigned and Gerald Ford became president. • In April 1975 and on into the spring, North Vietnam overran South Vietnam, creating communist Vietnam. • In May 1975 the Mayaguez was hijacked in the South China Sea. President Ford ordered a military action to retake the ship. More United States Marines died in the action than people were rescued. • President Carter extended amnesty to Vietnam War draft evaders on his first day in office in 1977. • Also in 1977, the United States initiated negotiations with Panama for the transfer of control of the Panama Canal to Panama. The negotiations resulted in a treaty that the Senate narrowly ratified. • In 1979 Cuban-backed Sandinistas rose to power in Nicaragua after President Carter removed support for the country’s dictator, a longtime friend of the United States, over the issue of human rights. • In December 1979 the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. President Carter pulled the U.S. Olympic team out of the Moscow Olympics. • In November 1979 Iranians overran the United States Embassy in Tehran and took 66 Americans hostage. The United States talked tough but only levied economic sanctions. A military rescue attempt in 1980 failed. AP® UNITED STATES HISTORY 2009 SCORING GUIDELINES (Form B) Question 5 Information List (continued) Time Line Date Event 1970 United States invades Cambodia.
