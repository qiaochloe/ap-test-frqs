High scores will be earned only by essays that both cite key pieces of evidence from the documents and draw on outside knowledge of the period. 1. Analyze developments from 1941 to 1949 that increased suspicion and tension between the United States  and the Soviet Union. Use the documents and your knowledge of the period 1941-1949 to construct your response. Document A Source: Senator Harry S Truman to a newspaper reporter, June 1941 If we see that Germany is winning, we ought to help Russia and if Russia is winning we ought to help Germany and that way let them kill as many as possible. Document B Source: The United States ambassador to the Soviet Union to Secretary of State Cordell Hull, August 10, 1943 The absence of a second front prepares the ground for a strong Soviet stand in the field of foreign policy. To the extent that people [around the world] believe that the Soviet Union carried the major burden of winning the war and that the United States and Great Britain withheld assistance which they could have given, [people] will be more inclined to support a claim that the Soviet Union should have the greatest voice in determining the peace. Document C Source: Joseph Stalin, February 6, 1945 Prime Minister [Churchill] has said that for Great Britain the question of Poland is a question of honor. For Russia it is not only a question of honor but of security. . . . During the last 30 years, our German enemy has passed through this corridor twice. © 2006 The College Board. All rights reserved.

If we can keep them maneuvered into a position where it is always hard and unprofitable for them to take action contrary to the principles of the United Nations and to our policies and where there is always an open door and an easy road to collaboration . . . I personally am quite convinced that . . . sooner or later the logic of it will penetrate their government and will force changes there. Document E Source: V. M. Molotov, Soviet foreign minister, “The Task of Our Time:  Unite Against the Enslavement of the People,” broadcast to the Russian people, November 6, 1947 Today the ruling circles of the United States and Great Britain head one international grouping which has as its aim the consolidation of capitalism and the achievement of the domination of these countries over other peoples. . . . Take, for example, the German question. If in the postwar period America and Britain had adhered to all the principles—let us say, for example, the democratic principles—of the Yalta and Potsdam conferences on the German question, which made possible and fruitful the collaboration of the great allies against Hitlerite Germany, with the aim of liquidating the remnants of fascism, then collaboration between the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain would also today produce good results. But the United States and Britain have departed from these democratic principles and have violated the decisions jointly taken. Document F Source: The New York Times, February 25, 1948 PRAGUE, Wednesday, Feb. 25—The “action committees” of Communist Premier Klement Gottwald were taking over authority in the capital and throughout Czechoslovakia yesterday in what looked like a revolution. The country was rapidly being turned into a “People’s Front” nation of the typical Eastern European variety. Ministries of the Government were brought under control of the Communists, the army was told to “remain true to the Soviet Union,” the free press was being suppressed and the Gottwald forces apparently gained the support they needed to form a majority regime. © 2006 The College Board.
