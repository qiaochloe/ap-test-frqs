The test preparation materials in this document include images for which descriptions are provided. In a standard test, the images are presented without descriptions. In this document, descriptions are included with the images so that assistive technology users will have an understanding of what is in each image. However, some of the image descriptions may not be valid for testing purposes; and in certain cases we cannot make all of the content accessible due to the construct or design of particular test questions.  Therefore, on an actual test in an alternate format, some questions may be omitted if they include images that cannot be described without affecting the question’s validity. If any questions are omitted, the scoring rules for the test take such omissions into account to make sure that you are neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by the omissions and that your scores are comparable to those of individuals taking another version of the test.A P logoAP® United States History 2015 Free-Response Questions© 2015 The College Board.

 “None of Nature’s landscapes are ugly so long as they are wild.” John Muir, 1901 “I recognize the right and duty of this generation to develop and use the natural resources of our land; but I do not recognize the right to waste them, or to rob, by wasteful use, the generations that come after us.” Former president Theodore Roosevelt, 1910 2.

What do we mean by the revolution? The war? That was no part of the revolution; it was only an effect and consequence of it. The revolution was in the minds of the people, and this was effected from 1760 to 1775, in the course of fifteen years, before a drop of blood was shed at Lexington.” Former president John Adams to former president Thomas Jefferson, August 1815 “There is nothing more common than to confound the terms of the American Revolution with those of the late American war. The American war is over: but this is far from being the case with the American Revolution. On the contrary, nothing but the first act of the great drama is closed. It remains yet to establish and perfect our new forms of government; and to prepare the principles, morals, and manners of our citizens, for these forms of government, after they are established and brought to perfection.” Benjamin Rush, signer of the Declaration of Independence and delegate to the Continental Congress, January 1787 3. Using the excerpts, answer (a), (b), and (c). a)	 Briefly describe ONE significant difference between Adams’ understanding and Rush’s understanding of the American Revolution. b)	 Briefly explain how ONE specific historical event or development from the period between 1760 and 1800 could be used to support Adams’ interpretation. c)	 Briefly explain how ONE specific historical event or development from the period between 1760 and 1800 could be used to support Rush’s interpretation. 4.

Document 1 Source: Barry Goldwater, a Republican senator from Arizona, The Conscience of a Conservative, 1960. Franklin Roosevelt’s rapid conversion from Constitutionalism to the doctrine of unlimited government is an oft-told story....Iam here concerned...bythe unmistakable tendency of the Republican Party to adopt the same course. The result is that today neither of our two parties maintains a meaningful commitment to the principle of States’ Rights. Thus, the cornerstone of the Republic, our chief bulwark against the encroachment of individual freedom by Big Government, is fast disappearing under the piling sands of absolutism.... The root evil is that the government is engaged in activities in which it has no legitimate business. As long as the federal government acknowledges responsibility in a given social or economic field, its spending in that field cannot be substantially reduced. Document 2 Source: Milton Friedman, economist, Capitalism and Freedom, 1962. We now have several decades of experience with governmental intervention.... Which if any of the great “reforms” of past decades has achieved its objectives?... A housing program intended to improve the housing conditions of the poor, to reduce juvenile delinquency, and to contribute to the removal of urban slums, has worsened the housing conditions of the poor, contributed to juvenile delinquency, and spread urban blight.... The greater part of the new ventures undertaken by government in the past few decades have failed to achieve their objectives. The United States has continued to progress; its citizens have become better fed, better clothed, better housed, and better transported; class and social distinctions have narrowed; minority groups have become less disadvantaged.... All this has been the product of the initiative and drive of individuals co-operating through the free market. Document 3 Source: Letter to Nelson Rockefeller, Republican governor of New York, February 6, 1971. This letter is written to you by a law abiding citizen who feels she is discriminated against in favor of dope addicts and welfare cheats. I am a widow who lives alone, works every day, pays taxes and lives by the rules. I get very little from my taxes when I can no longer walk on the streets and when I am afraid in my own home.... Sorry this letter is not typed. My typewriter was stolen. Document 4 Source: Jerry Falwell, television evangelist and founder of the Moral Majority, Listen, America!, 1980. We must reverse the trend America finds herself in today. Young people between the ages of twenty-five and forty have been born and reared in a different world than Americans of years past. The television set has been their primary baby-sitter. From the television set they have learned situation ethics and immorality—they have learned a loss of respect for human life. They have learned to disrespect the family as God has established it. They have been educated in a public-school system that is permeated with secular humanism. They have been taught that the Bible is just another book of literature. They have been taught that there are no absolutes in our world today. They have been introduced to the drug culture. They have been reared by the family and the public school in a society that is greatly void of discipline and character-building. These same young people have been reared under the influence of a government that has taught them socialism and welfarism. They have been taught to believe that the world owes them a living whether they work or not. From AMERICA: A NARRATIVE HISTORY, SEVENTH EDITION by George Brown Tindall & David E. Shi.

This philosophy once occupied a hallowed place in American diplomacy, but it was casually... dismissed at the outset by the Carter Administration—and the results have been shattering. Never before in modern history has the United States endured as many humiliations, insults, and defeats as it has during the past four years: our ambassadors murdered, our embassies burned, our warnings ignored, our diplomacy scorned, our diplomats kidnapped. The Carter Administration has shown that it neither understands totalitarianism nor appreciates the way tyrants take advantage of weakness. The brutal invasion of Afghanistan promises to be only the forerunner of much more serious threats to the West—and to world peace—should the Carter Administration somehow cling to power. Document 6 Source: Teddi Holt, a homemaker, a member of Georgia Stop ERA, and the national president of Mothers On the March, 1984. I am pleased that God blessed me with the privilege of being a woman. I have never been envious of the role of men but have had respect for both sexes. There’s no doubt that there has been discrimination against women, but that is past history, just as discrimination against blacks is past history in the US.... Just what were we women to be liberated from? These women [feminists] were calling for liberation from the things women like me love most—our husbands, our children, our homes. My cry became: “God, liberate us from the Liberators!”... We believe that the mothers of this and other nations must stand up for the protection of our homes and our children. In no way are we extremists, unless we be guilty of extreme devotion to our husbands, our children, and our homes. It is our sincere belief that if we do not unite against the threats to the home, if we retire to the convenience and security of our houses and do not speak out, then it will not be long until we, the “keeper at home” (Titus 2.5) will not have a home to keep! Excerpt from “Women Who Do and Women Who Don’t Join the Women’s Movement” by Teddi Holt and edited by Robyn Rowland, Copyright © 1984 by Teddi Holt.
