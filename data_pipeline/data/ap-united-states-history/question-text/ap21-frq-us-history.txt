The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, which could have been adopted only under the conditions of radical reconstruction, make the blunders of that era... dwindle into insignificance.” Kenneth M. Stampp, historian, The Era of Reconstruction, 1865–1877, published in 1965 “Whether measured by the dreams inspired by emancipation or the more limited goals of securing blacks’ rights..., Reconstruction must be judged a failure. “...For the nation as a whole, the collapse of Reconstruction was a tragedy that deeply affected the course of its development. If racism contributed to the undoing of Reconstruction, so also Reconstruction’s demise... accelerated racism’s spread, until by the early twentieth century it pervaded the nation’s culture and politics.” Eric Foner, historian, A Short History of Reconstruction: 1863–1877, published in 1990 1. Using the excerpts above, answer (a), (b), and (c). a) Briefly describe ONE major difference between Stampp’s and Foner’s historical interpretations of Reconstruction. b) Briefly explain how ONE specific historical event or development in the period from 1863 to 1900 not directly mentioned in the excerpts could be used to support Stampp’s argument. c) Briefly explain how ONE specific historical event or development in the period from 1863 to 1900 not directly mentioned in the excerpts could be used to support Foner’s argument. The figure presents a pamphlet titled “Do you want your wife to work after the war?” The pamphlet shows a woman in work clothes looking into a mirror and doing her makeup.

Roosevelt’s statement on signing the GI Bill of Rights, June 22, 1944 [This bill] gives servicemen and women the opportunity of resuming their education or technical training after discharge, or of taking a refresher or retrainer course, not only without tuition charge up to $500 per school year, but with the right to receive a monthly living allowance while pursuing their studies. It makes provision for the guarantee by the Federal Government of not to exceed 50 percent of certain loans made to veterans for the purchase or construction of homes, farms, and business properties. Document 2 Source: Property deed to the McIntosh family for a home in Seattle, Washington, 1947 This deed is made subject to the following restrictions, conditions, limitations, covenants and agreements, which shall run with the land and be binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators.... 1. No part of said property shall ever be used or occupied by any person of any Asiatic, Negro, Hawaiian, or Malay race, or any person of extraction or descent of any such race, and the grantee or his successors in interest, shall not place any such person in possession or occupancy of said property, or any part thereof, or permit said property, or any part thereof, to be used or occupied by any such person, except that these provisions shall not prevent the residence upon said property of persons of any such race actually employed in domestic or menial service upon said property by occupants of said premises qualified by race as occupants hereunder. Document 3 Source: “This is How I Keep House,” McCall’s magazine, 1949 Bringing a new baby into a tiny city apartment, Helen Eckhoff says, taught her as nothing else could the importance of good housekeeping equipment and careful planning before and after a baby arrives. When she and [her husband] Bob discovered, shortly after moving to [a suburb], that they were going to have a second child they began planning for it months in advance.... One of Helen’s greatest joys in her new home is the washing machine, which takes care of the family’s regular laundry...and is invaluable for all the slip covers, curtains, etc., that Helen plans to have spic and span before the baby comes.... Besides her house cleaning economies she saves time for the weekend by carefully planning her Saturday baking and by preparing casserole dishes and quick refrigerator desserts. “It means” she says, “that Bob and I have just about as much social life as we ever did. Naturally I don’t gad about, but there’s always time to have people over. On Saturday night we usually have a television party. Refreshments are simple and we don’t use many dishes so it’s just as relaxing for me as for the guests.” Document 4 Source: Automobile advertisement, 1950 The figure presents an advertisement page titled “Now thousands own two fine cars!” The following three paragraphs are provided below the title. Paragraph 1: When over a quarter million families are two car families, there must be a reason! And there are many! They are sold on the convenience of two cars in general and the economy of this car in particular! Paragraph 2: With scientifically contoured Power Dome combustion chambers both the 100 horse power V 8 and the 95 horsepower Six give the high compression performance on regular gas — a saving that really adds up! And remember, for style this car has been awarded the Fashion Academy’s Gold Medal as “Fashion Car of the Year” for the second year in a row. Paragraph 3: “Test Drive” it at your Dealer’s today. The car you now own may well provide the down payment on two new cars! To the right of these paragraphs there is a picture titled “The Convertible,” which shows a man with  a dog and talking to three women in and around a convertible. A caption below the picture reads: Nothing is smarter, nothing more fun to drive. Your choice of fabric and leather or all leather upholstery and 11 different body colors. And the top goes up or down in seconds, automatically. Below this paragraph a banner reads: There’s a car in your future…with a future built in. Below this banner is a picture titled “The Two Door Sedan,” which shows two women feeding a goose next to a car with a man in the driver’s seat. A caption below the picture reads: A “personal” car with all quality features! Mid Ship Ride! Lifeguard Body! 35 percent easier acting King Size Brakes! And a Deep Deck Luggage Locker that holds all the bags and baggage!The Advertising Archives / Alamy Stock Photo Document 5 Source: William H. Whyte, Jr., The Organization Man, 1956 This book is about the organization man....[Organization men] are not the workers, nor are they the white-collar people in the usual, clerk sense of the word. These people only work for The Organization. The ones I am talking about belong to it as well. They are the ones of our middle class who have left home, spiritually as well as physically, to take the vows of organization life, and it is they who are the mind and soul of our great self-perpetuating institutions.... They are all, as they so often put it, in the same boat. Listen to them talk to each other over the front lawns of their suburbia and you cannot help but be struck by how well they grasp the common denominators which bind them.... Theyare wry about it, to be sure; they talk of the “treadmill,” the “rat race,” of the inability to control one’s direction. But they have no great sense of plight; between themselves and organization they believe they see an ultimate harmony.... From The Organization Man, by William H. Whyte.

The following cities are indicated on the map: New York, Washington D.C., Atlanta, St. Louis, Chicago, San Antonio, Denver, and San Francisco. Most of the highways in the northeast and southeast are 4 lane or more highways. There are slightly more 2 lane highways in the New England region and in the Southeast. In the northeast, southeast, and northern Midwest, the highways are more tightly intertwined than in other regions on the map. Throughout the western half of the United States, there are about an equal number of 2 lane and 4 lane or more highways.Document 7 Source: A. Q. Mowbray, journalist, Road to Ruin, 1969 [An engineering firm] laid out a freeway system for the city of Nashville.... [Interstate Route 40], instead ofcoming straight into the city, would swing north on a wide loop through the center of the Negro community in North Nashville, where it would wipe out Negro homes and churches, slice through a Negro college complex, and run along the main business street for sixteen blocks, wiping out all the Negro-owned businesses on one side of the street and isolating those on the other side from their customers. Some 650 homes, 27 apartment buildings, and several churches would be pounded into rubble. Isolation of the ghetto would be increased by the creation of fifty dead-end streets along the course of the expressway. END OF DOCUMENTS FOR QUESTION 1 Question 2, 3, or 4 (Long Essay) Suggested writing time: 40 minutes Directions: Answer Question 2 or Question 3 or Question 4. In your response you should do the following. Respond to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning. Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. Support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant examples of evidence. Use historical reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, continuity or change over time) to frame or structure an argument that addresses the prompt. Use evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the prompt. 2. Evaluate the extent to which trans-Atlantic voyages in the period from 1491 to 1607 affected the Americas. 3. Evaluate the relative importance of causes of reform activity in the United States in the period from 1800 to 1848. 4. Evaluate the extent to which international conflicts in the period from 1898 to 1930 affected the role of the United States in the world. WHEN YOU FINISH WRITING, CHECK YOUR WORK ON SECTION II IF TIME PERMITS. STOP END OF EXAM
