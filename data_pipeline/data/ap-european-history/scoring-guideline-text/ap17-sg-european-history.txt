Students should both identify and explain an aspect of family life that remained consistent despite sweeping changes in the social, political, and economic landscapes of European history. Mere generalizations that “women stayed in the home” and “men were breadwinners” should not receive credit because they do not go beyond a basic, stereotypical understanding of European family life. Responses must relate to an aspect of family life that is grounded in this specific time period (family as primary economic unit, continued child labor, individual contributions to family economy) and that goes beyond a vague identification of women’s roles as solely domestic and of men working outside the home. Students should both identify and explain an aspect of European family life that changed between 1700 and 1900. Broad and vague statements such as “women began working” or “people moved to cities” should not receive credit because they do not go beyond a superficial description of a trend during this period. Responses must identify a valid change in family life that is grounded in this period and explain its significance (women now engaged in wage work and contributing to family economy, a move away from extended family networks toward nuclear families due to urbanization’s effects). Students must identify and explain an additional, distinct change in family life between 1700 and 1900 in order to earn credit for task (c). Reponses to each task may appear out of sequence or can be mislabeled. Short Answer Question 1 (continued) Acceptable responses for part (a) (not an exhaustive list): • Patriarchal family structure (responsible for decision-making, legal status) • Continuity of women’s roles in child-rearing and domestic work as primary roles but not as sole roles • Children’s labor continuing as part of family economy • Family as primary economic unit Acceptable responses for parts (b) and (c) (not an exhaustive list) — (b) and (c) MUST be distinct: • Women’s labor (now compensated by wages, likely to be outside of domestic work) • Family shifting from being primarily a unit of production to a unit of consumption • Urbanization (reasons why, effects of) • Growth of Cult of Domesticity/separate spheres/increasingly defined gender roles • Lower birthrates/smaller families (reasons why, effects of) • Family structure moving from extended to nuclear model • Concept of childhood as a distinct developmental period/increasingly nurturing parenting • Movement from parent-based child education to compulsory, state-run model • Limitations in/changes to child labor • Leisure activities more prevalent (better living conditions, access to leisure in urban environments) 0–3 points Score 3  Response accomplishes all three tasks set by the question.  Score 2  Response accomplishes two of the tasks set by the question. Score 1  Response accomplishes one of the tasks set by the question.  Score 0  Response accomplishes none of the tasks set by the question.  Score NR Is completely blank Scoring Guide a) One point for one cause, from 1450−1500, that contributed to the geographical distribution of printing centers in Europe. b) One point for one short-term cultural OR political effect, from 1500−1550, of the emergence of printing centers. c) One point for one long-term effect, from 1550−1789, of the spread of printing on European society. Scoring Notes Acceptable responses for part (a) (not an exhaustive list): • Growing prosperity of trading cities in the Italian and German states, as well as the Low Countries • Growing interest in classical learning • Growth of humanism and vernacular literature • Development of Gutenberg press in German states in 1440s • Population distribution • Patterns of urbanization Acceptable responses for part (b) (not an exhaustive list.): • Spread of Christian humanism in northern Europe • Spread of Protestant ideas • Diffusion of Renaissance values • Vernacular bibles • Spread of Scientific Revolution • Development of literacy • Emergence of censorship on written works • Use of written work to enhance monarchical authority • Use of written works to challenge the political authority of the Church or political entities Acceptable responses for part (c) (not an exhaustive list): • Growth of vernacular literature • Development of national feeling and culture • Popularization of science • Enlightenment develops and spreads • Challenges to political and social order • Continuing growth of Scientific Revolution • Growth and spread of literacy rates and education • Aids the Catholic reformation • Development of “public opinion” and political culture • Peace of Augsburg (likely cued by 1550) • Factor in French Revolution (likely cued by 1789) • Political fragmentation • Religious fragmentation 0–3 points Score 3 Response accomplishes all three tasks set by the question. Score 2 Response accomplishes two of the tasks set by the question. Score 1 Response accomplishes one of the tasks set by the question. Score 0 Response accomplishes none of the tasks set by the question. Score NR Is completely blank Scoring Guide a) One point for using one piece of evidence to support Judt’s argument regarding the creation of the welfare states.

Acceptable responses for part (a) (not an exhaustive list): • Points out that God created the universe. • Notes that the earth is at the center of the universe. • Mentions that the creation of the universe is part of a divine plan, following ideas expressed in the Bible (Old Testament). • Mentioning that part of the passage is in tune with Christianity more generally will not suffice here. The response must address views of the cosmos. Acceptable responses for part (b) (not an exhaustive list): • Mentions the existence of moons orbiting around Jupiter (which calls into question the geocentric model, since everything in the cosmos does not revolve around the earth) • Explains that the earth is no longer at the center of the universe and that there is more to the universe than man’s creation • Argues that the cosmos is more complicated and complex than traditionally believed (reference again to Jupiter’s moons, sun spots, etc.) Short Answer Question 4 (continued) • Raises the possibility of intelligent beings on other “Globes,” which contradicts the notion that humans on earth are the only form of intelligent life in the universe. • Again, the responses to this question must explain how the passage challenges traditional views of the cosmos. It is thus about science, and not about epistemology (ways of knowing, ways of thinking). Acceptable responses for part (c) (not an exhaustive list): This question asks for explanations of scientific discovery and its consequences for perspectives on nature. This is also not a question about ways of knowing. So, simply referring to Bacon, Descartes, or similar individuals, arguing that they encouraged people to question church teaching, to inquire directly into how nature worked rather than taking statements on faith, will not suffice to earn a point for part (c). • That said, we have accepted the “discovery” of the heliocentric model (by Copernicus) and its popularization (by Galileo, and others) as a fundamental challenge to traditional views about nature that are embedded in the Ptolemaic geocentric model. • Reference to Kepler’s and Galileo’s work on celestial orbits (they are not perfect circles – ellipses in fact; they are also not fully regular – they “wobble”), which contradict traditional views of planets traveling on perfectly circular orbits • Referencing Newton’s work on gravity and laws of motion, which challenged traditional views of nature in a number of ways, including further discrediting the notion of geocentrism and demystifying nature by demonstrating that it is knowable through rational inquiry. • Explains how Harvey’s discovery of the circulation of blood challenges prevailing understanding of the human body’s functioning • Notes that the “discovery” of the telescope permits humans to directly observe and thus question the organization and functioning of the universe (it is thus not simply a matter of following biblical or church teaching on the heavens) , Question 1 — Document-Based Question Maximum Possible Points: 7 “Evaluate whether or not the Glorious Revolution of 1688 can be considered part of the Enlightenment.” Points  Scoring Rubric  Scoring Notes  A: Thesis and Argument Development 0-2  Thesis: Presents a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim and responds to all parts of the question. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion. (1 point)  • Acceptable thesis statement must EXPLICITLY address a significant aspect of the Enlightenment (e.g., religious toleration, natural rights, or limited government) and its relationship to the Glorious Revolution  Argument Development: Develops and supports a cohesive argument that recognizes and accounts for historical complexity by explicitly illustrating relationships among historical evidence such as contradiction, corroboration, and/or qualification. (1 point)  • A “two-sided” argument could recognize complexity by noting the mixed motivations for Glorious Revolution (e.g., religious conflict vs. a desire for limited government). • A “one sided” argument that doesn’t account for the nuances and/or contradiction should not earn the Argument Development point, BUT a “one-sided” argument that DOES acknowledge nuance and contradiction could achieve this point. • Another way to achieve this point would be to argue how MULTIPLE aspects of the Enlightenment are reflected in the Glorious Revolution.  B: Document Analysis 0-2  Document Analysis (Content): Utilizes the content of at least six of the documents to support the stated thesis or a relevant argument.

Thesis and Argument Development (2 points) a)Thesis Responses earn 1 point by presenting a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim that responds to all parts of the question. While the thesis does not need to be a single sentence, it does need to be discrete, meaning it cannot be pieced together from across multiple places within the essay. It can be located in either the introduction or the conclusion, but not split between the two. Examples of acceptable theses: • “The Glorious Revolution of 1688 is a part of the Enlightenment due to its focus on the ideals of liberty, constitutional government, and the rights of the people.” (Thesis takes an evaluative and historically defensible stance while fully addressing the prompt.) • “The Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England should be considered a part of the Enlightenment because it gave citizens of Great Britain rights and vowed to protect them, however, it cannot fully be considered a part of the Enlightenment due to the lack of religious tolerance by some of the people who supported this revolution.” (Thesis takes an evaluative and historically defensible stance while fully addressing the prompt.) • “The Glorious Revolution of 1688 can be considered a product of the Enlightenment era but can no doubt be revealed to be motivated by older ideals of religious intolerance as well as newer, more liberal values of rights.” (Thesis is basic but takes an evaluative and historically defensible stance and fully addresses the prompt.) Examples of unacceptable theses: • “Although the Glorious Revolution happened in the 17th century and not the 18th century, it happened in England and not France, and Voltaire had not been born at that time, it could be considered part of the Enlightenment according to the behavior of the king and the government, the response of the people, and comments from other countries.” (Thesis does not explicitly address a significant aspect of the Enlightenment.) • “While the Glorious Revolution did have some similar ideas of the Enlightenment, it cannot be considered part of the Enlightenment itself due to the fundamental nature of the Revolution and reasoning behind it.” (Thesis does not explicitly address a significant aspect of the Enlightenment.) • “Although the Glorious Revolution occurred in England, it may be considered to be a major part of the Enlightenment movement due to the introduction of legal documents that encouraged Enlightenment ideals as well as the emergence of Enlightenment intellectuals during this time period.” (Thesis does not specifically address a significant aspect of the Enlightenment.) b) Argument Development Develops and supports a cohesive argument that recognizes and accounts for historical complexity by explicitly illustrating relationships among historical evidence such as contradiction, corroboration, and/or qualification. Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Examples of acceptable argument development: • To support an argument that the Glorious Revolution was part of the Enlightenment, responses may use the documents to show that the Glorious Revolution exhibits early Enlightenment ideals later articulated by Enlightenment philosophes, such as limited monarchy, increased rights for citizens, and educational, legal, and economic reforms. (Notes a clear pathway from the Glorious Revolution to the Enlightenment noting the complexity of change.) • To support an argument that the Glorious Revolution was part of the Enlightenment, responses may use the documents to show that while both secular and religious reforms do follow Enlightenment ideals, Protestantism remains the dominant religion. (Notes contradictory evidence but accounts for it in the broader argument.) • To support an argument that the Glorious Revolution was part of the Enlightenment, responses may use the documents to show that both secular and religious reforms were part of the Enlightenment because of the increasingly constitutional nature of the reforms and religious toleration was both promised and enacted. (A one-sided argument that notes nuances and contradictions within the argument.) Examples of unacceptable argument development: • Responses may misuse significant documents to support an argument. For example, a response may attempt to argue that the Glorious Revolution was entirely about religious toleration or alternatively entirely about the imposition of Protestantism on England. (Responses misuse or misinterpret the documents to support an argument that may be historically indefensible.) • Response attempts to make an argument, but simply restates the content of the documents without linking the Glorious Revolution to the Enlightenment. (Responses do not posit an argument or may group like documents to attempt to formulate an argument but do not link to the Glorious Revolution or the Enlightenment.) • Responses are chronologically confused and argue that the entire Glorious Revolution is influenced by the works and ideas of Enlightenment philosophes like Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Rousseau. Alternatively, ideas of Renaissance humanism also render most arguments indefensible. (Responses are indefensible based upon significant factual error.) B. Document Analysis (2 points) a) Document Content Responses earn 1 point by utilizing the content of at least six of the documents to support the stated thesis or a relevant argument. Responses cannot earn a point by merely quoting or paraphrasing the documents with no connection to a thesis or argument. (See the document summaries for descriptions of document content.) Examples of acceptable utilization of content from a document to support a thesis or relevant argument: • “After previous violent events, many people anticipated the arrival of King William III, ‘whom they looked to be the deliverer from tyranny.’” (Doc 1) (Explains the peaceful transition towards a more constitutional monarch.) • “In the English Bill of Rights the points of freedom of speech and parliamentary process are very strongly stated as rights of the country.” (Doc 3) (Provides specific examples of Enlightenment principles found in the Glorious Revolution.) • “John Locke says the people have a right to revolt if the government fails to protect their rights and property.  Under James II the right of religious freedom was not protected which is why the Glorious Revolution occurred.” (Doc 5) (Provides specific example of an Enlightenment principle found in the Glorious Revolution.) • “Source 7 also highlighted the giving of liberties to the people. In this visual source, William III is holding the people’s rights to dispense to them.” (Doc 7) (Explains the extension of an Enlightenment principle rooted in the Glorious Revolution.) b) Significance of Point of View, Purpose, Context, and/or Audience Responses earn 1 point by explaining the significance of the author’s point of view, author’s purpose, historical context, and/or audience for at least four documents. (See the document summaries section below for brief description of possible point of view, purpose, historical context, or audience for each document.) Examples of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s point of view: • “Burnet may have wanted William to look good since they were friends, and as an Anglican priest he had to support Protestantism.” (Doc 4) (Explains Burnet’s rationale for both speaking well of William and of Protestantism.) • “John Locke witnessed the Glorious Revolution take place and was English so he may have had some bias in favor of the event.” (Doc 5) (Notes the eye witness experience that may have informed Locke’s conclusions.) • “This excerpt reflected Voltaire’s personality in many ways since he disliked the absolute monarchy in France during the 18th century and had a positive view of England.” (Doc 6) (Explains why Voltaire would be predisposed to support the results of the Glorious Revolution.) Examples of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s purpose: • “In many ways William might have exaggerated his duty to cement his place as a ruler and may have vehemently supported Protestantism to earn the favor of the British people. Regardless, he did strengthen the religion delivering on his promise.” (Doc 2) (Notes the desire of William to be seen as legitimate and popular.) • “Voltaire’s purpose is to merely direct attention to a government acting effectively on Enlightenment philosophies and thus this source is very reliable in defending the Glorious Revolution’s place in the Enlightenment.” (Doc 6) (Recognizes that Voltaire would wish to provide evidence of the validity of his ideas.) • “William may have wanted to make himself look too good in order to have the youth of England prefer him, and the message may have exaggerated William’s accomplishment but since someone had taken the time to make a woodcut of William and his wife, he was certainly loved by the people.” (Doc 7) (Recognizes the possibility that William would wish to appear extremely generous to the youth of his adopted country.) Examples of acceptable explanation of the significance of the historical context of a document: • “Given that the English Bill of Rights was passed immediately following the Glorious Revolution and the end of James II’s rule, it is meant to safeguard the rights of the citizens and to hold Parliament to be the ultimate power.” (Doc 3) (Notes the immediacy of the Bill of Rights to cement the results of the Glorious Revolution.) • “It is understandable that Voltaire wrote this piece in support of the Glorious Revolution because, as a philosophe during the Enlightenment, he was dedicated to using reason and rational thought to improve society.” (Doc 6) (Notes the application of Enlightenment thought on an evaluation of the events of the Glorious Revolution.) Examples of acceptable explanation of the significance of the audience: • “This source is somewhat unreliable because while it does come directly from the King it is a declaration and may therefore hide William’s true feelings in an attempt to gain support from the citizens.” (Doc 2) (Recognizes the possible manipulation of information in order to appeal to a citizenry.) • “The woodcut was placed in a book and the intended audience was children to help educate the youth of England of the accomplishments of the Glorious Revolution.” (Doc 7) (Recognizes the value of propaganda when aimed at an impressionable segment of the population.) C. Using Evidence Beyond the Documents (2 points) a) Contextualization Situates the argument by explaining the broader historical events, developments, or processes immediately relevant to the question. Examples might include: • Wars of Religion/Thirty Years’ War • The Stuart Restoration • Hobbes’ political thought • English Civil War • Rise of absolutist theories and regimes outside England • English tradition of parliamentary power • James II’s attempts to assert absolute power in England • Rise of empiricism/Scientific Revolution • European rationalist political philosophers • Growing literacy and education Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Examples of acceptable contextualization: • “In the late 15th century, and even a few decades after Martin Luther’s 95 Theses, England was an almost entirely Catholic nation. But Henry VIII’s creation of the Anglican church, in addition to increased Protestant momentum throughout northern and central Europe, had led to a largely Protestant population. Therefore, when James II tried to impose Catholicism on the English, it was met with fierce resistance.” (Explains one of the reasons for the animosity in the religious rivalry that helped fuel the Glorious Revolution.) • “The Glorious Revolution of 1688 occurred because the King of England’s next heir was a Catholic, while the rest of the country was mostly Protestant. The English did not want a Catholic king, so they had William and Mary come from the Netherlands to take the crown from James II because they were Protestant. The monarchy in England had only recently been restored after the Civil War and the Protectorate had eliminated it.” (Narrative is sharpened with the explanation of why a king was deposed and another invited to rule as a constitutional monarch.) • “As the Wars of Religion in Europe began to end with the Thirty Years’ War meeting its conclusion in 1648, philosophers and educated men began to ponder the question of innate rights. Some argued that man is a morally benevolent creature who must be protected, however, those like Hobbes argued that mankind would only be able to restrain its darker impulses under firm, authoritative law. This question of rights was brought to the forefront during England’s Glorious Revolution.” (Explains why one of the possible aspects of the Enlightenment would be part of the Glorious Revolution.) Example of common errors in contextualization: • Responses may have errors in contextualization because of fundamental chronological mistakes.   Despite the fact that Voltaire’s dates are given in Document 6, the ideas of the Enlightenment philosophes are cited as informing the events of the Glorious Revolution. Situating the argument in events that have not yet happened negates the argument and also contextualization. b) Evidence Beyond the Documents Responses earn a separate point for providing an example or additional piece of specific evidence beyond those found in the documents to support or qualify the argument. (Items in contextualization list may also be deployed as outside evidence, but no single piece of evidence can be used for both.) Examples of providing an example or additional piece of specific evidence beyond those found in the documents to support or qualify the argument: • “In the Bill of Rights it states that the royals cannot dismiss Parliament or the laws it creates without consent, which is a change from Cromwell’s displacing Parliament and taking complete power before this with Cromwell’s Protectorate, showing the huge step in Enlightenment ideals.” (A historical event not referenced in the documents is used to explain some provisions of the Bill of Rights and linked to Enlightenment ideals.) • “Freedom of speech and the end of cruel punishments were extremely important aspects of the Enlightenment. Cesare Beccaria, an important Enlightenment figure, often spoke out against the use of torture and cruel punishment.” (A relevant Enlightenment figure not mentioned in the documents is referenced to support an Enlightenment principle present in the Glorious Revolution.) • “Influenced by earlier English documents, such as the Magna Carta which outlined natural rights, the Glorious Revolution guaranteed freedom.” (An additional fact that further supports the argument that the Glorious Revolution was a step on the road to the Enlightenment.) D. Synthesis (1 point) Responses earn a point for synthesis by extending their argument in one of three possible ways, by explaining the connection between the argument and either a development in a different historical period or geographical area, a course theme and/or approach that is not the focus of the essay, or a different discipline: Examples of acceptable synthesis by appropriately connecting the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographic area: • “The Glorious Revolution provided much support and examples of the implementation of Enlightenment ideals like natural rights and the role of government, yet it seemed to combat religious tolerance. The Revolution is similar to the ideas of the American Revolution. In both, ideas of the Enlightenment shined with Bills of Rights for both nations. Yet, anti-Enlightenment ideals of slavery and non-religious tolerance continued.” (Response includes an explicit and accurate comparison to a different revolution in order to support an argument that the Glorious Revolution can be considered to be part of the Enlightenment.) • “This situation with the Glorious Revolution is very similar with how Khrushchev of the Soviet Union de-Stalinized the country after Stalin died by repealing the oppressive laws and debunking Stalin in front of his former supporters, Khrushchev ushered in a new era in the USSR where freedoms were slowly gained back.” (Response includes an explicit and accurate comparison to a different arguably revolutionary event in order to support an argument that the Glorious Revolution can be considered to be part of a movement for progressive reform.) Examples of acceptable synthesis by connecting the argument to different course themes and/or approaches to history that are not the main focus of the question: • “Parliament was not only able to protect private property but further expand in later years a man’s right to trade and affect commerce without significant governmental intervention which would lead to a flourishing British economy and the rise of a stronger merchant class.” (Response cites the broader context of economic development to contextualize the argument of the role of government in continued progressive reform.) Examples of acceptable synthesis by connecting the argument to different disciplines or fields of inquiry (hypothetical): • Responses may argue that while the Glorious Revolution is sometimes seen as a demonstration of the Enlightenment ideal of popular sovereignty, Parliament only represented a small fraction of the population, mostly landed and merchant interests, and popular support for William was largely based on religious issues. (Responses use political science principles to make an argument about the nature of the Revolution.) Maximum Possible Points: 6 “Describe and explain a significant similarity and a significant difference between the ways European states waged war in the period circa 1500–1648 and in the period circa 1750–1871.” (Historical thinking skill: Comparison) Please note: • Each point of the rubric is earned independently, e.g., a student could earn the point for synthesis without earning the point for thesis. • Unique evidence from the student response is required to earn each point, e.g., evidence in the student response that qualifies for one of the other targeted skill points could not be used to earn the point for thesis. Points  Scoring Rubric  Scoring Notes  A: Thesis 0-1  Thesis: Presents a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim and responds to all parts of the question.

Thesis (1 point) Responses earn 1 point by presenting a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim that responds to all parts of the question. For the purposes of earning the thesis point, the thesis statement does not need to both describe and explain a similarity and a difference in the ways in which European states waged war, but it should offer a brief statement of the argument that will be developed in the body of the essay. While the thesis does not need to be a single sentence, it does need to be discrete, meaning it cannot be pieced together from across multiple places within the essay. It can be located in either the introduction or the conclusion but not split between the two. Examples of acceptable theses: • “The ways in which nations waged war from 1500 to 1648 and in the period 1750−1871 were similar in that alliances were a significant factor in wars in both time periods, but they differed because 16th−17th century wars were primarily religious while 18th-19th century wars were politically and economically motivated.” (Addresses both a similarity and a difference and takes a historically defensible position.) • “Following the Thirty Years’ War, the reasons behind going to war began to shift from ecclesiastical to secular. However, regardless of the time period war was seen as a sense of pride for a nation and brought about unity among the people. While the reasons behind starting war may have shifted, the nationalist sentiment it sparks in the people has not changed.” (Indicates a shift in reasons for war as a difference and provides a general but acceptable similarity.) • “In both time periods, European states waged war for the similar purpose: to stop foreign aggression and to expand the territory and influence of their own. But they differ significantly in developments in fighting technologies, such as mobilization, transportation, communication, weapons, and medicine.” (Though general, thesis provides defensible similarity and difference between the two periods.) Examples of unacceptable theses: • “Priorities and technology have altered the reasons and methods of warfare. From 1800−1871, a constant in the way war occurs is the presence of a strong, driven leader, and one difference between war from 1500 to 1648 and 1750 to 1871 is the motivation behind warfare, as earlier leaders used religion as their motive and later leaders used politics and unification as their motivation for war.” (Addresses difference, but “strong driven leader” is too general and ahistorical to receive credit for similarity.) • “The ways in which European states fought wars between periods 1500−1648 and 1750−1871 differed in the ideology and cause but were the same in terms of devastation and casualty.” (Categories for both similarity and difference are overly broad and lack a sense of chronology.) B. Argument Development: Using The Targeted Historical Thinking Skill (2 points) a) Argument Development — Describes (1 point) Responses earn 1 point by describing at least ONE relevant example of a similarity and ONE relevant example of a difference in the ways in which European states waged war in the period 1500−1648 and in the period 1750−1871. (1 point) Examples of acceptable description of similarity and/or difference: • “Even though these wars might be fought for the same cause, the armies that fought in them were significantly different. Countries between 1500−1648 widely employed mercenaries to fight in wars. In the period 1750–1871, however, countries depended on their standing national armies … In all, in both time periods, European states waged war for the similar purpose: to stop foreign aggression and to expand the territory and influence of their own.” (Describes a specific difference and specific similarity between the periods.) • “The leaders of Europe were always concerned with the balance of power. When Sweden was forced to retire from the 30 Years War, France engaged to prevent powerful Austria from winning. During the French Revolution, the European nations formed coalitions against the French to keep them in check … However, the wars of the 16th/17th centuries were different from those of the 18th/19th centuries because wars in the earlier period were waged in order to achieve religious goals, while those in the later period were waged for economic and political reasons.” (Describes a specific similarity and a specific difference between the periods.) • “Contrasting with the Thirty Years’ War which drew primarily on religious alliances, the French-British rivalry was over colonial possessions, expansionist ambitions, and pure rival of power … In both periods, the use of early firearms was present. Mainly inaccurate rifles and muskets were used prevalently in both since gunpowder comes from the East. Also, the use of cannons and cavalry existed in still large numbers in both time periods. During both of these periods, the conquest of native populations, whether it be in Central or South America or Africa, was partaken by European powers.” (Describes a specific difference and specific similarities between the periods.) b) Argument Development — Explains (1 point) Responses can earn 1 point by explaining the reasons for at least ONE relevant example of a similarity and ONE example of a difference in the ways in which European states waged war in the period 1500−1648 and in the period 1750−1871 and linking them back to a relevant argument. (1 point) Examples of acceptable explanation of reasons for similarity and difference: • “The Diplomatic Revolution of 1756 demonstrated a new image of international warfare, as pure competition of power. Religion was able to play a less important role in forming alliances due to a constant decline in Church power (and thus in the power of the Holy Roman Empire) and a rising popularity of Enlightenment ideals of religious freedom … As the causes of war changed, the action itself still brought nations and allies together. In the early seventeenth century, while still fueled by religious distress, the conflict between Spain and the Netherlands brought the English and the Dutch together as allies … As for the later time period, conflicts continued to unite the people of a country against a common enemy. The Napoleonic Wars brought so much strength and power to France that it also created a sense of national pride that quickly spread to other countries.” (Explains a reason for a difference and a similarity between the two periods with reference to major historical developments.) • “Prior to the Thirty Years’ War, all aspects of life revolved around religion, including war. The division of the Church caused by the Protestant Reformation created a lot of tension between European powers based on newly found beliefs. However, the Thirty Years’ War represents a turning point in this belief. Protestant nations were seen supporting Catholics and vice versa, showing that war was becoming more about the political and economic benefits to a nation rather than its beliefs … The greatest similarity between the ways European states waged war was the struggle against powerful nations that sought to break the balance of the continent … During 1500−1648 and 1750−1871, wars were mainly fought against the most ambitious nations and powerful nations of Europe. For example, the long-time struggle between the French kings against the Habsburgs and the Ottoman Turks versus the majority of the Christian state were all caused by the growing power of these countries … The same pattern lasts to 1750−1871 … Napoleonic France was fighting constantly against states that feared French power.” (Explains a reason for a specific difference and a specific similarity between the periods with reference to a major historical development.) • “The wars in these two periods were extremely similar because both featured complex alliance systems that affected the outcome of the wars. In the 16th century, for example, the Schmalkaldic League formed an alliance of German princes in favor of the spread of Lutheranism in the religious wars following the Protestant Reformation … Similarly in the 18th−19th centuries, alliances played a critical role in the Crimean War, in which Britain, France, and the Ottoman Empire established an unusual alliance that allowed them to prevent Russian expansion … Two major developments occur within the time frame of 1500−1648. The Renaissance, a rebirth to classical antiquity marked by individualism and secularism, as well was the Reformation, a split amongst Christians … Similarly, In the time period 1750−1871, Europe experienced the Enlightenment, an intellectual movement characterized as a belief in individual rights, as well as the rise of nationalism …These two developments also characterized war during their time period ... Thus, the 1500−1648 involved conflicts over the role of religion in society and for the individual … 1750−1871 had wars caused by the drive for national unity and rights.” (Explains reasons for a specific similarity and a specific difference between the periods with reference to major historical developments.) C. Argument Development: Using Evidence (2 points) a) Using Evidence — Examples (1 point) Responses can earn 1 point by addressing the topic of the question by referring to at least TWO specific examples or pieces of relevant evidence (1 point). Essays can earn this point without having a stated thesis or a relevant argument. Examples of specific evidence that could be used to address the topic of the question: • Conscription and citizen armies • Levée en masse • Nationalism • Thirty Years’ War/Peace of Westphalia • Industrialization • Colonialism and colonial wars • Professionalization • Various types of weapons and tactics (appropriate to period) • Meritocracy • Napoleon • Frederick the Great • Clausewitz • Realpolitik — Bismarck and Cavour • Mercenaries • Peace of Augsburg • Various wars and battles (appropriate to period) b) Using Evidence — Effective Substantiation (1 point) Responses earn a separate point by utilizing specific examples of evidence to fully and effectively substantiate a thesis or relevant argument addressing a similarity and a difference in the ways in which European states waged war in the period 1500−1648 and in the period 1750−1871 (1 point). Fully and effectively substantiating the thesis goes beyond merely providing many examples. This point is earned by clearly and consistently linking significant evidence to the argument and showing how the evidence demonstrates similarity and difference in the ways in which European states waged war. Examples of evidence that could be utilized to substantiate an argument: • “Another aspect to war that was similar was the introductions of the newest technologies. In 15001648, firearms just began to become prevalent and were employed. Similarly, in 1750-1871, technology such as artillery and modern rifles were used in order to gain an advantage over the opposing side….In 1500−1648, wars mostly dealt with religion. In the Thirty Years’ War, it centered on Protestants vs. Catholics. The Church and the Holy Roman Empire held vast influence and wanted to stop their ideological opponents…This is much different from wars in 1750−1871. The balance of power played a huge role in the breakout of war. Many of the coalitions against Napoleon formed in order to prevent France from dominating the continent.” (Uses specific examples to support and substantiate an argument related to a similarity and a difference between the periods.) • “The way that European nations waged war in the periods circa 1500−1648 and 1750−1871 was similar because they often battled over colonies. For example, from 1618−1648, France and England fought for colonies in North America. They both believed in the economic theory of mercantilism and desired as much land in the New World as possible … In the late 1700s, Britain waged war with the United States of America, because it wanted freedom from British rule. The American Revolutionary War resulted in Britain losing its North American colonies, like France did after the Seven Years War … Between 1500–1648 armies were small. For example, the Battle of Ltzen fought between Swedes and Catholic alliance forces involved less than 50,000 men altogether. However, between 1750−1871, war became huge. Napoleonic France mobilized more than 3 million men, and battles such as Leipzig involved near to a million soldiers. Also, technology changed rapidly between the two time periods. While the former used smaller, clumsier ships, the latter developed gigantic battleship and later, steamboats and steel ships for service … The first time period lacked efficient means of communication, while the second developed telegrams and a successful mailing system, as was shown in the Crimean War.” (Uses specific examples to support and substantiate an argument related to a similarity and differences between the periods.) D. Synthesis (1 point) Responses earn 1 point for synthesis by extending their argument in one of three possible ways, by explaining the connection between the argument and either a development in a different historical period or geographical area, a course theme and/or approach that is not the focus of the essay, or a different discipline. Example of acceptable synthesis by appropriately connecting the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographic area: • “In North America, the time periods between 1500−1648 and 1750−1871 also exhibited some significant differences and similarities. Wars in 1500−1648 were mainly fought between neighboring native tribes over land and resources and then later between colonists and natives. In 1750−1871, wars became global as the American Revolution produced intense fighting between colonists and the British. The War of 1812 exhibited a global component as resentment over British policies and French holdings in Louisiana led the Americans to conflict.” (Extends the argument regarding differences between the two periods to an additional geographic region — North America.) Example of unacceptable synthesis attempting to connect the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographic area: • “The reign of Napoleon was very similar to that of Hitler. Both men had huge egos and were completely focused on power and conquest. Both men tried to invade Russia in the works and both failed. All they cared about was power. They wanted to be #1.” (Though similarities are noted across the period in question to one outside it, the discussion does not extend the argument of the essay.) Example of synthesis by connecting the argument to a different course theme or approach to history: • “Just as religion motivated war in the period 1500−1648 while economics prompted it in later years, family life in the 1500s was centered more around the Church, as exemplified by the Lutheran ideal of women as spirited helpmates. In the 19th century, the family became focused more on industrialization and the earning of wages.” (Extends argument regarding change from religious to political motives for warfare to similar principles organizing family life in the periods.) Example of unacceptable synthesis attempting to connect the argument to a different course theme or approach to history: • “Politically, during 1500 to 1648 and 1750 to 1871 there were many monarchies. But by the start of the 1800s, people began agitating for a newer, freer government. Though mercantilism was used in the 1500-1648 period, by the middle of the 1750−1871 period European states began to prefer classical economics and laissez faire.” (Adds additional category of economics, but the discussion does not extend the argument, only refers to trends.) Example of synthesis by connecting the argument to a different discipline or field of inquiry: • Responses can extend their argument by appropriately connecting their argument to a different discipline, such as psychology or sociology, to extend a comparison of warfare in the two periods. Maximum Possible Points: 6 “Describe and explain a significant similarity and a significant difference between European governments’ role in the economy in the period circa 1650–1750 and in the period circa 1850–1950.” (Historical thinking skill: Comparison) Please note: • Each point of the rubric is earned independently, e.g., a student could earn the point for synthesis without earning the point for thesis. • Unique evidence from the student response is required to earn each point, e.g., evidence in the student response that qualifies for one of the other targeted skill points, could not be used to earn the point for thesis. Points  Scoring Criteria  Notes  A: Thesis 0-1  Thesis: Presents a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim and responds to all parts of the question.

Thesis (1 point) Responses earn 1 point by presenting a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim that responds to all parts of the question. For the purposes of earning the thesis point, the thesis statement does not need to both describe and explain a similarity and a difference in European governments’ role in the economy, but should offer a brief statement of the argument that will be developed in the body of the essay. While the thesis does not need to be a single sentence, it does need to be discrete, meaning it cannot be pieced together from across multiple places within the essay. It can be located in either the introduction or the conclusion, but not split between the two. Examples of acceptable theses: • “For the governments in 1650−1750 and 1850−1950, their role in each respective economy was both similar and different. They were similar in that they both wanted colonies as a way to obtain natural resources, expand their influence, and gain revenue from trade. They were different in their economic systems, with mercantilism being popular in the 1650s and laissez faire dominating in the 1850s.” (Goes beyond the prompt, begins to develop arguments, responds to all parts of the question.) • “Between the years of 1650 to 1750 and the years of 1850 to 1950, European governments played a role in the economy due to their practices of colonialism and imperialism to some degree. However, government role in the economy differed between these periods due to an increased use of capitalism and laissez faire practices in the economic sphere.” (Historically defensible stance, fully addresses the prompt.) • “Throughout history governments have changed their role in the economy. 1650−1750 and 1850−1950 were similar in that the government still requires taxes and controls some distribution of wealth. They were different, though, in how they managed the social classes and what the government owned.” (Responds to all parts of the question, historically defensible stance.) Examples of unacceptable theses: • “The government in Europe played both a major role but also did not in economics. The government in 1650−1750 played a major role, but in 1850−1950 the government was different from the other era and didn’t play a major role. Also, how the economies in the world wars were connected to their governments.” (Merely restates prompt, no explanatory element.) • “Europeans’ economy during the 17th century and 18th century was growing in money, while in the late 19th century and 20th century Europe was in debt, but both eras had economic growth with gaining of resources.” (Too general and simplistic, not historically defensible.) • “European governments throughout history have had different levels of influence and role on the economy, depending on the type of government and economic plan.” (Does not address all parts of the question.) B. Argument Development: Using The Targeted Historical Thinking Skill (2 points) a) Argument Development — Describes (1 point) Responses earn 1point by describing at least one relevant example of similarity and one example of difference in European governments’ role in the economy in the period circa 1650–1750 and in the period circa 1850–1950. (1 point) Examples of acceptable description of similarity and difference: • “During 1650−1750, European governments favored mercantilism … The government used protectionism during this time to ensure goods would be brought to the country and the economy would flourish. However, in 1850−1950, countries moved away from mercantilism to industrialization. The government now allowed businesses and factories to produce goods for the people … Though the period of 1850−1950 saw less government monopolies on goods, the government still protected their own interests. Similar to how countries used protectionism, countries began to regulate and determine what businesses could do during the period of 18501950. For example, during WWII England converted regular factories to factories that produced war equipment. This is similar to how the government decided where the economy went with trading during the period of 1650−1750 because it shows how the businesses and factories were still under the rule of that individual country.” (Accurately describes a difference and a similarity.) • “In 1650−1750 and 1850−1950, European governments heavily invested in overseas trade with their colonies … Despite the previously mentioned similarity, government regulation in industry shifted from virtually no involvement in the 1650−1750 period to high government regulation and industry reform during 1850−1950.” (Accurately describes a similarity and a difference, laying particular emphasis on difference, the greater intervention in the second period compared to the first.) b) Argument Development — Explains (1 point) Responses can earn the point here by explaining at least one relevant example of similarity and one example of difference in European governments’ role in the economy in the period circa 1650–1750 and in the period circa 1850–1950 and linking them back to the argument. (1 point) Examples of acceptable explanation of reasons for similarity and difference: • “In both communism and mercantilism, the government heavily regulates the economy. With a mercantilist economic policy, the government had the right to impose high tariffs on goods from other European countries and their colonies to discourage the purchase of foreign goods. Communism was similar as Lenin and Stalin attempted to limit dependence on western goods. In both economic policies self-sufficiency is encouraged … Mercantilism and communism have different degrees of political involvement because mercantilism promotes interaction with other nations and allowed for private businesses to make a profit through trade, while communism regulated all aspects of life and the goods produced were equally distributed amongst the members of the community.” (Explains the reasons for both similarity and difference.) • “In both time periods, France’s power was measured by territory and influence. They fought tooth and nail to keep Algeria … Indochina, or modern day Vietnam, gave France rubber imports and a connection with the rich trade of Asia. Earlier, France had held territory in Canada and in the center of the modern day continental U.S. They also had slave colonies … Of course, other European powers got boost to their economies from having colonies abroad … In 1850−1950, governments were now seen as “for the people” in a new way. This goes to show how much more important the government had to consider the health of its citizens. This was reflected in economic policy, as bringing good lives and prosperity to the people became an expectation of European governments. Economic socialism was a rising theme, a contrast to the horrid treatment lower classes were subjected to as the focus was on nobles and the force of mercantilism.” (Explains the reasons for both similarity and difference.) • “Through the late 1600s and early 1700s European nations such as the English, Dutch, and French worked to colonize new territory in order of economic gain … Likewise, governments from 18501950 such as the English or France used mercantilist tactics to expand and colonize areas of importance (refers to partition of Africa) … While the two different government eras had many similarities they also had strict differences such as welfare and government intervention and capitalism and private ownership. In the 17th and 18th century governments did not play a large role … This way of government proved much different than socialist methods instituted in the 20th century. In the 20th century government intervention rose as communism spread through Eastern Europe.” (Explains a similarity and a difference.) C. Argument Development: Using Evidence (2 points) a) Using Evidence — Examples (1 point) Responses can earn 1 point by addressing the topic of the question by referring to at least TWO specific examples or pieces of relevant evidence (1 point).

Fully and effectively substantiating the thesis goes beyond merely providing many examples. This point is earned by clearly and consistently linking significant evidence to the argument and showing how the evidence demonstrates similarity and difference in European governments’ role in the economy. Examples of evidence that could be utilized to substantiate an argument: • “From 1650−1750 and from 1850−1950, European governments profited heavily off of other areas of the world. From 1650−1750, the trade of sugar cane and foods to Europe and the shipment of slaves created a heavily profitable industry. European governments reaped the economic rewards and increased wealth that came at the expense of African slaves and Native Americans. While slavery was outlawed in most European countries by the early 18th century, harsh European control did not change. For example, King Leopold of Belgium exploited the people of his colony the Congo … Similarly, while direct imperialism was in decline by World War II, many European powers maintained influence in their colonies, such as Great Britain did in India … One major change in European governments’ role in the economy was the level of restriction the government placed on the economy. From 1650−1750, most Europeans followed an economic practice of mercantilism. Based off of the ideas of one of the French king Louis XIV’s ministers Colbert, mercantilism was an economic principle that a country’s wealth could be measured by its amount of gold. Another primary component of mercantilism was that wealth was finite, and so in order to stay strong economically, a country had to export more goods than it imported … European governments established tight tariffs and economic restrictions to ensure that their country produced more than it bought … This changed greatly with the adoption of more liberal practices. As outlined in Adam Smith’s book Wealth of Nations, free trade and little economic interference would guide the economy. Free trade, Smith argued, would act like an invisible hand, and protect the economy on its own. Smith’s assertions were far more economically effective, and from 1850−1950, governments loosened their grip over the economic market to promote growth.” (Uses specific examples in order to substantiate an argument about similarity and difference.) • “In both time periods they emphasized foreign markets. During the first time period we saw the rise of imperialism. Countries such as Britain, Spain, and Portugal colonized and controlled many places across the globe. One of the main incentives was to gain money off of these colonies. So these big powers set up mercantilism to gain the special resources that lie in their colonies so that they could sell it to others. In the second time period governments also focused on foreign markets. This is when we had quite a few major wars. Many of these big countries relied on the exports and imports to gain resources and money so that it can go to the military … The major difference between the two periods was how active they were in the economy. During the first time period ideas such as mercantilism and capitalism were famous and used by most governments. The governments were very active in how the money flowed. For example Britain’s government would directly control its imports from colonies. This applied to most governments across Europe, since most were authoritative governments and believed that government needed to control the economy. However this changed by the time the second period came around. Adam Smith created the term laissez faire. It essentially meant for a government’s economy to thrive, the government had to take its hands off the economy and let it do its own thing. Many governments started to adopt this new idea as their base for their economy. Between the two time periods the governments of Europe handled their economies differently.” (Uses examples to support arguments about similarity and difference.) D. Synthesis (1 point) Responses earn a point for synthesis by extending their argument in one of three possible ways, by explaining the connection between the argument and either a development in a different historical period or geographical area, a course theme and/or approach that is not the focus of the essay, or a different discipline. Examples of acceptable synthesis by appropriately connecting the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographic area: • “Stalin, who created the collectivization of farms, was very reminiscent of the enclosure movement that previously occurred. In the early 1800s, peasants were kicked off their farms and were forced to move to the cities. Stalin’s collectivization had a similar effect, where the government took control of farms, showing that this economic policy existed throughout history.” (Links essay question with another period.) • “The change to involved government is paralleled in American history, from a laissez faire government to an active one. FDR’s New Deal and the Progressive movement before it changed policy from Hoover’s inactivity to a new policy that the government has a responsibility to its people to take care of them.” (Links essay question with another geographical area.) Examples of synthesis by connecting the argument to a different course theme or approach to history: • “The government involvement in science for these two eras was also significant. From 1650 to 1750, the governments of Europe, which were widely Christian, denounced all scientific advances and discoveries. From 1850 to 1950, the secular government had taken hold, so the government did nothing to stem scientific research. In fact, European governments supported science from 1850 to 1950.” (Links essay question with governments’ role in scientific developments.) Examples of synthesis by connecting the argument to a different discipline or field of inquiry: • Responses can extend their argument by appropriately connecting their argument to a different discipline, such as psychology or sociology, to extend a comparison of governments’ role in the economy in the two periods. Example of a failed synthesis attempt: • “While each period had different governmental styles when it came to regulating the economy, they were also similar in the fact that they both had substantial middle classes that were able to buy these products. However, in the 1650s the middle class was largely made up of educated merchants, professionals, and intellectuals while in the 1850s−1950s, the middle class likely would have been made up of professionals such as doctors and teachers, and businessmen and government officials.” (Makes an attempt to connect the essay topic to a different theme, in social history, but the reference to the nature of the middle classes is overgeneralized and repetitive.)
