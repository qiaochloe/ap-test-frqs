Provides an appropriate, explicitly stated thesis that directly addresses all parts of the question. Thesis must not simply restate the question. The thesis must address at least two factors with some degree of specificity (beyond general categories) that relate to the prompt. The thesis must suggest a minimal level of analysis drawn from the context of the documents, though a student does not need to use the term “factor” or “instability” explicitly. The thesis need not appear in the first paragraph.  2. Discusses a majority of the documents individually and specifically. The student must use at least six documents — even if used incorrectly — by reference to anything in the box. To get credit for this point, documents cannot be referenced collectively (e.g., “Documents 2, 3 and 6 suggest”) unless the student goes on to discuss them individually.   3. Demonstrates understanding of the basic meaning of a majority of the documents (may misinterpret no more than one). The student must use six documents correctly and may not significantly misinterpret more than one document. A major misinterpretation is an incorrect analysis or one that leads to an inaccurate grouping or a false conclusion. The student cannot earn this point if credit was not awarded for point 2 (discusses a majority of the documents).  4. Supports the thesis with appropriate interpretations of a majority of the documents. The student must use at least six documents correctly, and the documents used in the body of the essay must provide support for the thesis. The student cannot earn this point if credit was not awarded for point 1 (appropriate thesis). The student also cannot earn this point if credit was not awarded for point 2 (discusses a majority of the documents).  5. Analyzes point of view or bias in at least three documents. The student must make a reasonable effort to explain why a particular source expresses the stated view by • relating authorial point of view to author’s place in society (motive, position, status, etc.) OR • evaluating the reliability of the source OR • recognizing that different kinds of documents serve different purposes OR • analyzing the tone of the documents; must be well developed Note:  1) Attribution alone is not sufficient to earn credit for point of view.  2) It is possible for students to discuss point of view collectively, but this counts for only    one point of view. Question 1—Document-Based Question (continued)  6. Analyzes documents by explicitly organizing them in at least three appropriate groups. A group must contain at least two documents that are used correctly and individually. Groupings and corresponding documents may include the following (not exclusive).  GROUPS • Political parties: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11 • Pro-Republic: 1, 2, 4, 6 • Anti-Republic: 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11 • Communists: 3, 5 • Anti-Communist: 1, 4, 6, 8, 11 • Nazis: 7, 11 • Anti-Nazi: 4, 10 • Radical/resistance groups: 3, 5, 7, 8, 11 • Weak/inexperienced  leadership: 6, 7, 8, 9 • Apathy toward democracy: 6, 8, 10 • Postwar bitterness: 8, 9, 11 • Economic: 3, 5, 10, 11 • Militarism: 3, 4, 5, 8, 11 • Prowar/Promilitary: 5, 7, 8, 11 • Antiwar/Antimilitary: 3, 4 • Writers: 4, 6, 8, 10 • Women: 2, 3  EXPANDED CORE: 0–3 points to a total of 9 points  Expands beyond the basic core of 1–6. The basic score of 6 must be achieved before a student can earn expanded core points. Credit awarded in the expanded core should be based on holistic assessment of the essay. Factors to consider in holistic assessment may include:   • Presents a clear, analytical and comprehensive thesis. • Uses all or almost all of the documents (10–11 documents). • Uses the documents persuasively as evidence. • Shows understanding of nuances of the documents. • Analyzes point of view or bias in at least four documents cited in the essay. • Analyzes the documents in additional ways (e.g., develops more groupings). • Recognizes and develops change over time. • Brings in relevant outside information.    Question 2  Analyze the ways in which European monarchs used both the arts and the sciences to enhance state power in the period circa 1500–1800.  9–8 Points • Thesis explicitly identifies ways in which European monarchs used the arts and the sciences to enhance state power in the period circa 1500–1800. Thesis does not need to be in the opening paragraph. • Organization is clear, consistently followed and effective in support of the argument. a) May devote individual paragraphs to an examination of the use of the arts and the sciences by monarchs to enhance state power. b) May identify individual monarchs and consider how each ruler used the arts or the sciences or both to enhance state power; does not have to present both categories for each monarch. • Essay is well balanced; the ways in which monarchs used the arts and the sciences to enhance state power are analyzed at some length. Essay covers a broad chronological time period and more than a single monarch. • Major assertions in the essay are supported thoroughly and consistently by relevant evidence. Evidence of the arts may prove more specific or concrete. • May contain errors that do not detract from the argument.  7–6 Points • Thesis explicitly identifies ways in which European monarchs used the arts and the sciences to enhance state power in the period circa 1500–1800 but may not be developed fully. • Organization is clear and effective in support of the argument but may introduce evidence that is not pertinent to the task. • Essay covers all major topics suggested by the prompt but may analyze a particular topic, time period, state or monarch in greater depth rather than in a balanced manner. • Major assertions in the essay are supported by relevant evidence. • May contain an error that detracts from the argument.  5–4 Points • Thesis identifies ways in which monarchs used the arts and the sciences to enhance state power but without any development; thesis may address only part of the question effectively; thesis may be a simple, single-sentence statement. • Organization is clear but may not be consistently followed; essay may veer off task chronologically or thematically or both. • Essay may not complete all tasks: a) May discuss only the arts OR the sciences. b) May discuss only a narrow chronology. c) May focus only on one monarch. d) May be primarily descriptive rather than analytical. • Essay offers some relevant evidence. • May contain errors that detract from the argument. Question 2 (continued)   3–2 Points • Thesis may simply paraphrase the prompt OR identify the ways in which European monarchs used the arts and the sciences without linking to the enhancement of state power. • Organization is unclear and ineffective; essay may focus on the personal attributes of some European monarchs rather than the use of the arts and the sciences to enhance state power. • Essay shows serious imbalance; discussion of the ways in which European monarchs used the arts and sciences to enhance state power is superficial; much of the information may be significantly out of the time period of the question. • Offers minimal OR confused evidence. • May contain several errors that detract from the argument.  1–0 Points • Thesis is erroneous OR irrelevant OR absent. • No effective organization is evident. • Discussion of the ways in which European monarchs used the arts and the sciences to enhance state power in the period circa 1500–1800 is generic. • Provides little or no relevant supporting evidence.  • May contain numerous errors that detract from the argument.    Question 3  Analyze the various Protestant views of the relationship between church and state in the period circa 1500–1700.  9–8 Points  • Thesis is explicit and fully responsive to the prompt; includes specific references to the nature of the relationship between church and state for at least two specific groups/views. • Organization is clear, consistent and effective in support of the argument. • Essay is well balanced; develops at least three separate views that are drawn from more than one geographic area. • Essay contains specific and appropriate supporting evidence of the relationship between church and state for at least three of the views cited. • May contain errors that do not detract from the argument.  7–6 Points • Thesis is explicit and responsive to the prompt; includes specific reference to the nature of the relationship between church and state for one or more of the groups/views cited. • Organization is clear and effective but may not be not consistently followed. • Essay is balanced; develops at least two separate and distinct views. • Essay contains specific and appropriate supporting evidence for at least two of the views cited. • May contain an error that detracts from the argument.  5–4 Points • Thesis is explicit but not fully responsive to the question; may fail to refer to specific views or simply name groups involved in the Protestant movement. • Organization may lack consistency. • Essay is somewhat unbalanced; may conflate the development of Protestantism with relationships between church and state. • Essay contains some specific supporting evidence but may use evidence unevenly. • May contain one or more errors that detract from the argument.  3–2 Points • Thesis may merely restate or paraphrase the prompt, or it may fail to respond to the charge specified in the prompt. • Organization is unclear or ineffective in support of an argument relative to the prompt. • Essay lacks balance; may focus only on development of Protestantism without linking to relationships between church and state. • Limited use of relevant supporting evidence. • May contain several errors that detract from the argument.  1–0 Points  • Thesis is missing or off task. • Organization is indiscernible in terms of responding to the prompt. • Essay does not respond to the prompt with relevant evidence or does so only in general terms.  • Little or no relevant supporting evidence is used. • May contain numerous errors that detract from the argument. Question 4  Analyze the various effects of the expansion of the Atlantic trade on the economy of Western Europe in the period circa 1450–1700.  9–8 Points  • Thesis is explicit and addresses both the Atlantic trade and the economy of Western Europe. • Organization is clear, consistent and effective in support of the argument. (Examples of organization are by country, commodity, time period or topic). • Facets of the Atlantic trade and impacts on the economy are clearly linked. • Examples of both trade and impact on the economy come from more than one Western European economy and from throughout the period (including the 1600s). • Provides specific evidence for at least two facets of the Atlantic trade in some detail. • Provides specific evidence for at least two impacts on the economy in some detail. • May contain minor errors that do not detract from the argument (e.g., describing cotton as an important commodity in the Atlantic trade before 1700).  7–6 Points • Thesis is explicit and addresses both the Atlantic trade and the economy of Western Europe. • Organization is clear, effective in support of the argument, but perhaps not consistently followed. • Essay is balanced overall; it covers both the expansion of the Atlantic trade and the effects of that expansion on the economy of more than one country, but it may discuss one topic (either trade or impacts) in more detail or offer a more superficial treatment of one part of the period. • Examples of trade and its impact on the economy may not be consistently linked. • Provides evidence for both the Atlantic trade and the impact on the economy, but it may be somewhat less specific or detailed. • May contain a major error or several minor errors that detract from the argument (example of a major error: England or France was a major player in the Atlantic trade before the late seventeenth century; example of a minor error: Portugal had a monopoly on the slave trade).  5–4 Points • Thesis is explicit but may be partial (it may discuss either the Atlantic trade or the effects of the trade on the Western European economy). • Organization is attempted but may not be consistently followed. • Essay is imbalanced; it may emphasize either the Atlantic trade or its effects, or it may discuss only part of the period 1450–1700 or the economy of only one country or of Western Europe generally. • Linkage between trade and the economy may be minimal or missing. • Supporting examples are present but may be less detailed. • May contain a few errors that detract from the argument (e.g., the Portuguese introduced the potato and corn into Europe).  3–2 Points • Thesis is confused, is implicit, is vague or merely repeats/paraphrases the prompt. • Organization may be unclear and ineffective. • Essay shows serious imbalance; it discusses only trade or the impact on the economy. • Evidence may be listed rather than discussed. • Linkage between trade and the economy may be absent. • May contain several errors that detract from the argument.  Question 4 (continued)  1–0 Points • No discernable attempt at a thesis. • No discernable organization. • One or none of the major topics suggested by the prompt is mentioned. • Little or no supporting evidence is used. • May contain numerous errors that detract from the argument. Question 5  Compare and contrast how TWO of the following states attempted to hold together their empires in the period circa 1850 to 1914. • Austria-Hungary • Russia • Ottoman Empire  9–8 Points  • Thesis is explicit and fully responsive to the question, mentions both countries specifically and is balanced. Shows some sophistication in addressing the comparison/contrast aspect. • Organization is clear, consistently followed and effective in support of the argument. • Argument focuses on attempts to hold the empire(s) together, rather than solely on the problems encountered.   • All major assertions in the essay are supported by multiple pieces of relevant evidence. These may include domestic reforms, diplomatic maneuvers and alliances, appointments – the countries need to be actors, not objects of action. • Should compare and contrast to some extent. • May contain errors that do not detract from the argument. 7–6 Points  • Thesis is explicit and responsive to the question but: need not be as sophisticated as an essay scored at level 8. • There is more variation in the level of comparison and contrast; one may be implied. • Organization is clear, effective in support of the argument but not consistently followed (may jump around a bit). • All major assertions in the essay are supported by at least one piece of relevant evidence. • May contain an error that detracts from the argument. 5–4 Points  • Thesis is explicit, but not fully responsive to the question. • May compare or contrast and do so implicitly (parallel argument). • Organization is clear, effective in support of the argument but not consistently followed. • Essay shows some imbalance.

A weak or invalid thesis may make little or no attempt at assessing the impact of Darwin and Freud.  • Organization is unclear and ineffective. • Essay shows serious imbalance. Essays in this category may address only the ideas of Darwin and  Freud or both and may make only minimal or incorrect attempts at assessing their impact on European ways of thinking. • Attempts at assessment of impact are supported by minimal evidence. • May contain several major errors that detract from the argument. Question 7 (continued)  1–0 Points  • Little or no discernable attempt at a relevant thesis. • Little discernable organization. • Little or no direct discussion of Darwin or Freud or their impact on European ways of thinking; essays in this category may be entirely or mostly off task. • Little or no supporting evidence used. • May contain numerous errors that detract from the argument.
