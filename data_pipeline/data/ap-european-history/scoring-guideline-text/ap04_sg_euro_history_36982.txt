Has an acceptable thesis. Thesis must be explicit, responsive to the question, and based on one or more documents. It may not be a simple rewording of the question or of the historical background. Thesis need not appear in the first paragraph. 2. Uses a majority of documents. Uses at least 6 documents by reference to anything in the box, even if used incorrectly.  They need not be cited by number or name. 3. Addresses all parts of the question. Must discuss both attitudes towards and responses to poverty.  May be, and usually are, conflated or only implicitly distinguished. 4. Understands the basic meaning of the documents cited in the essay. Significantly misinterprets no more than one document; a major misinterpretation is an incorrect analysis or one that leads to an inaccurate grouping or a false conclusion.  Two “almost major errors” = one major error. Errors in attempts to provide POV should be judged less severely. 5.Analyzes bias or point of view in at least threedocuments. Relates authorial point of view to author’s place (position, status, etc.) OR Evaluates the reliability of the source OR Recognizes that different kinds of documents serve different purposes OR Analyzes tone of documents – three weak attempts of this sort equal one POV. POV can be achieved collectively through analysis of motives of a group or explanations of reasons for group’s attitudes; counts as one POV. 6. Analyzes documents by grouping them in at least three groups. A group must have at least 2 docs. A fallacious grouping receives no credit.   Examples of possible groups [not exhaustive]: Catholic clergy 1, 8, 10 Protestants 6[?], 7, 9 Catholic countries 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11 [+6?] France 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11 Netherlands: 3 [Bruges], 4, 9 England 6, 7 Dangers of begging 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 Knowing the poor 3 [little], 6, 11 [a lot] Poor should be punished 5, 7 + 4, and 8 implicitly Poor should be regulated 2, 4, 5, 7, 8  Poor need treatment/help 2, 5, 8, 10 Poor seen sympathetically 3, 4, 9, 11 Undeserving vs. deserving poor 4, 5, 8, 9 Poor are idle 4, 5, 6, 8, 11 Towns 2, 5, 8 Politics/government 2, 4, 5, 8 Private individuals 3, 6, 9, 11 Family/women/children 3, 4, 9 Poor relief benefits donor [1, 10 religious; 2, 5, 8 secular] Poverty leads to immorality 3, 4 By century [change over time] 15th 1, 2; 16th 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; 17th 8, 9, 10, 11 EXPANDED CORE: 0-3 points to a total of 9 points Must earn all 6 points in the basic core before earning points in the expanded core.
