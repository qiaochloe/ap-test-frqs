Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s point of view: • (Document 3): “As an economist, Clark is primarily interested in maximizing the efficiency of the empire and describes the changes to Indians’ way of life as a fair application of free-market principles.” (Connects the point of view of the document to an argument about the influence of liberalism on British rule in India) Example of acceptable explanation of the relevance of the historical situation of a source: • (Document 5): “The rebellion of 1857–1858 was in part a religious uprising against British rule in India, so it is not surprising that Victoria is supporting the liberal idea of religious freedom in this document.” (Connects information about the historical situation of the quote with an argument about the influence of liberalism on British rule in India) Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the audience: • (Document 4): “Ghose’s pamphlet would likely have been read by British critics of rule in India, suggesting that he might be trying to appeal to British policymakers who wanted India to be ruled in a more liberal way.” (Provides information about the audience of the source relevant to an argument about the influence of liberalism on British rule in India)  Examples that do not earn this point: Identify the point of view, purpose, historical situation, and/or audience, but do not explain how or why it is relevant to an argument • “The ceremony recorded by Pulley in Document 6 occurred at a time when Britain had effectively taken control of all  of India.” Summarize the content of the document without explaining the relevance of this to the point of view, purpose, historical situation, and/or audience • “The purpose of Queen Victoria’s declaration is to grant religious freedom to all Indians.”  Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s purpose: • (Document 6) “This was drawn by an Englishman. It promotes the idea of a British savior and was likely used to glorify their imperialism.” (Identifies the artist’s purpose to promote Queen Victoria’s imperial rule)  Row D (continued)  Complexity  0 points Does not meet the criteria for one point.  1 point Demonstrates a complex understanding of the historical development that is the focus of the prompt, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the question.  Decision Rules and Scoring Notes  Responses that earn this point: May demonstrate a complex understanding in a variety of ways, such as: • Explaining nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables. • Explaining both similarity and difference, or explaining both continuity and change, or explaining multiple causes, or explaining both causes and effects. • Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across periods. • Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes. • Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence. Demonstrating complex understanding might include any of the following, if appropriate elaboration is provided: • Analyzing multiple variables, such as exploring the differences between the theoretical application of liberal ideas in India and the practical realities of maintaining order in an empire, or profiting from India’s wealth. (Explains nuance) • Explaining how liberalism as a political ideology was largely critical of British Imperialism in India, while at the same time recognizing how liberalism encouraged British imperialism in India economically, particularly through laissez-faire. The explanation should include some analysis of the relative strengths of each argument. (Demonstrates nuance by analyzing multiple aspects of liberalism and their effects on British India) • Analyzing multiple variables by constructing an argument that explores the potential conflict between liberal ideas about political equality and racialist ideas about the supposed inferiority of non-European races and attempts to reconcile them through the idea of “educating” or “reforming” native Indians. (Explains nuance) • Explaining insightful connections across periods by constructing an argument that explains how resistance to British rule, especially in the twentieth century, challenged the idea that Britain’s rule could be considered liberal. (Explains relevant and insightful connections) • Corroborating multiple perspectives, such as exploring how complaints about the actual workings of the British courts, indicate not only the failure of British rule to live up to liberal principles, but also the existence of liberal institutions such as a free press that could challenge the government. (Corroborates, qualifies or modifies an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence)  Additional Notes: • This demonstration of complex understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference.  Document Summaries Document  Summary of Content  1. Judge Russell on murder and arson case  • Russell declares that poor people and native Indians should receive equal protection of British law and says that this will ensure Indians’ allegiance to Britain.  • Legal decisions such as Russell’s need to explain the principles that they are based on, so he is laying out broad ideas. • Russell’s reference to protection of property and lives follows liberal and Enlightenment principals established by John Locke, while the closing reference to the allegiance of the governed similarly follows the liberal principal of the social contract.  2. Cobbett  • Cobbett criticizes British rule in India for its violence and greed.  • Cobbett is writing when the East India Company was acting as an autonomous governing body in India. • Cobbett is writing when the main aim of European overseas colonization was to gain access to luxury products to import to Europe.  3.

Ghose pamphlet  • Ghose criticizes the British legal system in India, claiming it is biased against Indians who often can’t access the courts, understand the language of the proceedings, or follow the legal arguments.  • Ghose, as a member of a reform group, is trying to state his case as strongly as possible, using the most emotional examples. • Ghose, as a reformer, is interested in articulating a critique of British government and legal institutions in India in an effort to establish, for his readers, the importance of political and social change.  5.
