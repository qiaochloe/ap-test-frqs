Short Answer Question 1  Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that follows.  “The best way to assess the depth and scope of the Scientific Revolution is to compare and contrast the science that came into fruition in the seventeenth century with its nearest equivalent in the late Middle Ages … Traditionally, knowledge had been based on faith and insight, on reason and revelation. The new science discarded all of these as ways of understanding nature and set up experience — experiment and critical observation — as the foundation and ultimate test of knowledge. The consequences were as revolutionary as the doctrine itself. For not only did the new method found knowledge on a wholly new basis, but it implied that men and women no longer had to believe what was said by eminent authorities; they could put any statement to the test of controlled experience.”     I. Bernard Cohen, historian, Revolution in Science, 1985  a) Identify TWO specific examples of scientific discoveries that support Cohen’s argument and explain how each discovery supports his argument.  b) Explain ONE way in which the shift in scientific inquiry described by Cohen affected European views of society or politics in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.   0–3 points   Score 3  Response accomplishes all three tasks set by the question.   Score 2  Response accomplishes two of the tasks set by the question.   Score 1  Response accomplishes one of the tasks set by the question.   Score 0  Response accomplishes none of the tasks set by the question.   Score — Is completely blank   Short Answer Question 1 (continued)  Scoring Guide  0–3 points • ONE point for identifying a specific example of a scientific discovery made during the Scientific Revolution AND explaining how that example reflects a change or movement away from the traditional medieval practice of science and acquisition of knowledge, as argued by Cohen. • ONE point for identifying a specific example of a scientific discovery made during the Scientific Revolution that is DIFFERENT from the one provided above AND explaining how that example reflects a change or movement away from traditional medieval practice, as argued by Cohen. • ONE point for explaining how new methods of scientific inquiry affected European views of society or politics during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.  Scoring Notes  Examples of responses to Part A that would earn credit: • Copernicus’s heliocentric view of the solar system proved that the Roman Catholic Church’s geocentric view of the universe was incorrect. • The increased emphasis on experimentation and empirical thought that lay at the heart of the new scientific method undermined faith in, and the authority of, the Catholic Church. • Newton’s theory of gravity, which was supported by mathematical calculations and observation, challenged medieval knowledge based on faith and revelation. • Advances in navigational and geographical knowledge permitted longer and safer sea voyages than possible in the Middle Ages when sailors lacked accurate maps and nautical technology. • Advances in mathematical knowledge and systematic observations of planets overturned the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic theories of astronomy.  Examples of responses to Part B that would earn credit: • New advances in science challenged the authority of the Catholic Church, which led to challenges in other areas of society or politics. People demanded greater participation in their government and the right to choose their own leaders. These types of political demands influenced the philosophies that helped lead to the American and French revolutions. • Increasingly rigorous demands for factual evidence to validate accusations gradually brought an end to the persecution of witchcraft in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. • The Scientific Revolution prompted Enlightenment thinkers to assert that the purpose of government is to cultivate goodness through rational organization and to implement ideas of meritocratic progress. • Enlightened absolute rulers in the eighteenth century were influenced by the Scientific Revolution’s ideas of rationalism and enacted new legal codes, promoted education, and suppressed feudalism based on those ideas.  Short Answer Question 2  Use the passages below to answer all parts of the question that follows.  “When [the Dutch burgher] goes home from Church, does he take God’s Holy Book with him to ponder the sermon? No. Instead he picks up the day’s [business] gazette and busies himself with calculations of interest and the liquidation of debts. It would be better [if] on the Lord’s Day he gave some accounting of himself and, instead of reckoning his profits, reckoned up his sins.”   Simonides, minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, Four Books on God’s Judgment, 1655   “So, Amsterdam has risen through the hand of God to the peak of prosperity and greatness . . .  The whole world stands amazed at its riches and from east and west, north and south they come to behold it. The Great and Almighty Lord has raised this city above all others … yea He has even taken from them the [commerce] of the east and the west (for in former times [other cities such as] Lisbon also flourished) and has spilled their treasure into our bosom.”   Melchior Fokkens, Dutch historian, Description of the Widely Renowned Merchant City   of Amsterdam, 1662  a) Describe ONE important difference between the views of commerce and prosperity expressed in the two passages.  b) For EACH of the passages, identify and explain ONE factor (such as a historical development, an intellectual or philosophical trend, or a religious belief) that likely informed the view of commerce and prosperity expressed in that passage.   0–3 points   Score 3  Response accomplishes all three tasks set by the question.   Score 2  Response accomplishes two of the tasks set by the question.   Score 1  Response accomplishes one of the tasks set by the question.   Score 0  Response accomplishes none of the tasks set by the question.   Score — Is completely blank   Short Answer Question 2 (continued)  Scoring Guide 0–3 points • ONE point for accurately describing an important difference between the views of commerce and prosperity expressed in the two passages by Simonides and Fokkens. • ONE point for identifying and explaining a factor (historical development, intellectual or philosophical trend, or a religious belief) that likely informed the view of commerce and prosperity expressed by Simonides. • ONE point for identifying and explaining a factor (historical development, intellectual or philosophical trend, or a religious belief) that likely informed the view of commerce and prosperity expressed by Fokkens.  Scoring Notes  Examples of responses to Part A that would earn credit: (1 Point) • Simonides is critical of businessmen and their interest in business because it interferes with God’s work. Fokkens instead praises business ventures as being a product of God’s work. • Simonides describes Dutch wealth as a distraction from spiritual needs. Fokkens sees Dutch wealth as a testament of God’s favor. • Simonides criticizes Dutch businessmen’s obsession with profit because it prevents them from engaging in religious pursuits. Fokkens sees financial success as a manifestation of God’s grace. • Simonides suggests that religion and commerce should be separate. Fokkens suggests that religion and commerce are intertwined.  Examples from Part B that would earn credit:  Simonides’s Passage: (1 Point) • Simonides’s commentary about the Dutch being too focused on “calculations of interest and liquidation of debt” could be supported by the influence of Protestantism and its critiques of the Catholic Church on the Dutch Reformed Church. • Simonides’s argument that the Dutch are too focused on “calculations of interest and liquidation of debt” could be supported by the increased Dutch wealth deriving from the formation of the Dutch East India Company, the increased participation of Dutch merchants in global commerce and the resulting decline of Spain as a world power, and the proliferation of art funded by wealthy merchants. • Simonides, as a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, was influenced by Protestant ideas about predestination, salvation by faith alone, the changing role of the clergy, and unnecessary wealth accumulation. Simonides is reacting to the increased religious pluralism of the Dutch community.    Short Answer Question 2 (continued)  Fokkens’s Passage: (1 Point) • Fokkens’s argument that “the whole world stands amazed at its [Amsterdam] riches” could be supported by the Dutch Golden Age and may include references to Dutch nationalism. • Fokkens’s argument that God “has raised this city above all others…” could be supported by the results of the Peace of Westphalia (1648), the decline of Catholic world powers such as Spain and Portugal, and the victories of Protestants over Catholics, especially in the Netherlands. • Fokkens’s characterization of Dutch prosperity relies on the historical development of Dutch trade and banking, such as the formation of the Bank of Amsterdam, the formation of Dutch East India Company, and the expansion of Dutch trade associated with overseas imperialism. • The prosperity described by Fokkens could be attributed to the proper adherence to Protestant doctrines, such as prosperity being a sign of God’s grace.  Short Answer Question 3  Many historians contend that the development of the railroad in the early 1800s was a significant

the development of railroads in the early 1800s was a significant turning point in European History       Short Answer Question 3 (continued)  Scoring Notes  Examples of responses to Part A that would earn credit: • The contention that the development of railroads in the early 1800s was a significant turning point in European history can be supported by railroads allowing for faster transportation of goods and raw materials that were necessary for production. • The contention can be supported by railroads helping to improve diets by providing improved access to perishable food. • The contention can be supported by the use of railroads for passenger transportation, initially for the middle class and, later, for the working class.  • The contention can be supported by railroads promoting economic expansion and growth by moving raw materials and finished goods more quickly and over greater distances. • The contention can be supported by states’ use of railroads for military mobilization and the rapid movement of armies. • The contention can be supported by railroads promoting colonial expansion and imperialism by allowing imperial European powers to move resources more quickly and efficiently. • The contention can be supported by railroads facilitating the rapid spread of information. • The contention can be supported by railroads promoting a common national identity by making it easier to move throughout the entire country. • The contention can be supported by railroads providing an opportunity for cultural interaction and increased access to leisure activities. Examples of responses to Part B that would earn credit: • The contention that the development of railroads in the early 1800s was a significant turning point in European history can be undermined by the fact that railroads in the early 1800s were not widespread throughout Eastern Europe. • The contention can be undermined by the fact that there were alternative forms of transportation for both goods and people, notably canals and steamships. • The contention can be undermined because passenger rail travel was limited to the middle and upper classes until late in the 19th century. • The contention can be undermined by a discussion of alternative economic and technological turning points more significant in the early 1800s than railroads, such as the Industrial Revolution or the steam engine.  Short Answer Question 4  Use the table below to answer all parts of the question that follows. Percent of the workforce

the period between 1800 and 2012. • ONE point for identifying a specific example of a broad trend that is DIFFERENT from the one provided above AND explaining how that broad trend contributed to changes in the patterns of employment in France in the period between 1800 and 2012 • ONE point for identifying a specific example of an effect on economic or social life in Western Europe AND explaining how that effect resulted from the transformations reflected in the table.  Scoring Notes  General scoring considerations for Part A: • The prompt requests that the response address the time period from 1800 to 2012, which could occur in one of two ways. First, the response could cover the entire period in discussing each one of the trends to be identified and explained. Second, each of the trends could cover a part of the period, but taken together the full period is addressed. If the response only addresses a part of the period (e.g., only the nineteenth century, only the twentieth), it may receive a maximum of one point for the task even if the identification and explanation of both trends is acceptable. • This task focuses on understanding causes and explaining causal relationships. Consequently, the responses need to indicate clearly how the trend contributes to the phenomena (organization of the French workforce over time) described in the table. Attention must also be paid to the temporal context. Answers that make sense for the twentieth century, for instance, may not be persuasive in relation to the nineteenth-century context. • The task also requires that two distinct trends be identified and explained. If the response only examines two consequences of one trend, it can only receive a single point. Acceptable responses for part A that would earn credit: • The Industrial Revolution resulted in the growth of the manufacturing sector. Moreover, by attracting workers from rural areas, it prompted reductions in the agricultural workforce. • The mechanization of agriculture promoted productivity gains that decreased the need for agricultural workers. • Increased international competition for industrial markets after 1950 resulted in decreased demand for industrial labor, but it also encouraged a shift towards the service sector, which explains the spike in the service workforce after 1950. • Improvements in educational access (mandatory primary schooling, expansion of university education [later]) contributed to the expansion of service-sector employment. • Technological progress decreased the needs for massive human resources in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors, permitting the expansion of service-sector employment.   Short Answer Question 4 (continued)   • The emergence of a consumer society after 1950 led to the creation of new employment opportunities in the service sector. • The expansion of the “modern state” during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries promoted major growth in the service sector (e.g., jobs in education, public health, government). • The rise of globalization after 1950 resulted in a decline of manufacturing jobs in France as traditional industrial work could now be accomplished more cheaply elsewhere. Note: Students often speak of an “agricultural revolution” in this question, but without a great deal of precision.   General scoring considerations for part B: • This task emphasizes explaining the effects of the transformations suggested in the table. The response must, therefore, clearly focus on explaining how the trends reflected in the table had an impact on Western European social or economic life.  • Note, too, that this task does not require that the response address the entire period covered in the table.  Acceptable responses for part B that would earn credit: • The growth in manufacturing jobs contributed to urbanization, since the new jobs in industry tended to be concentrated in cities. • The expansion of the workforce in manufacturing (especially industry) promoted the rise of ideologies like socialism and communism and also union movements, since they sought to improve workers’ lifestyles and promote the cause of social equality. • The shift from agricultural to manufacturing and service labor permitted individuals (and the working classes in particular) to save money and spend less time working, thereby contributing to the spread of leisure activity and consumerism. • The growth in manufacturing jobs and industrial conditions undermined traditional notions of family life and familial relations. • An increase in manufacturing jobs prompted the emergence of new social classes such as the “proletariat” and the “bourgeoisie” and a heightened awareness of social difference. • The steady increase in service-sector employment reflected both an expansion of the middle class in Western Europe and, overall, long-term improvements in the standards of living.   Question 1 — Document-Based Question  “Evaluate whether the policies of Otto von Bismarck’s government represented traditional conservatism or a new kind of conservatism in nineteenth-century Europe.”  Maximum Possible Points: 7  Please note: • Each point of the rubric is earned independently, e.g., a student could earn the point for argument development without earning the point for thesis. • Unique evidence from the student response is required to earn each point, e.g., evidence in the student response that qualifies for the contextualization point could not be used to earn the point for synthesis or the point for sourcing the documents.   A.  Thesis and Argument Development (2 points)    Targeted Skill: Argumentation (E1, E4, and C1) 1 point Presents a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim and responds to all parts of the question. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion.  Scoring Note: Neither the introduction nor the conclusion is necessarily limited to a single paragraph.  1 point  Develops and supports a cohesive argument that recognizes and accounts for historical complexity by explicitly illustrating relationships among historical evidence such as contradiction, corroboration, and/or qualification.   0 points Neither presents a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim and responds to all parts of the question nor develops and supports a cohesive argument that recognizes and accounts for historical complexity.  —  Is completely blank  B.

The contextualization point is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference, but instead requires an explanation, typically consisting of multiple sentences or a full paragraph.   Evidence Beyond the Documents  1 point Provides an example or additional piece of specific evidence beyond those found in the documents to support or qualify the argument.  0 points Does not provide an example or additional piece of specific evidence beyond those found in the documents to support or qualify the argument.  —   Is completely blank  Scoring Notes:  • This example must be different from the evidence used to earn other points on this rubric. • This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference. Responses need to reference an additional piece of specific evidence and explain how that evidence supports or qualifies the argument.    Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  D.  Synthesis (1 point)   Targeted Skill: Synthesis (C4, C5, or C6) 1 point Extends the argument by explaining the connections between the argument and one of the following: a) A development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area.  b) A course theme and/or approach to history that is not the focus of the essay (such as political, economic, social, cultural, or intellectual history).  c) A different discipline or field of inquiry (such as economics, government and politics, art history, or anthropology). 0 points Does not extend the argument by explaining the connections between the argument and the other areas listed.  —   Is completely blank.  Scoring Note: The synthesis point requires an explanation of the connections to a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area, and is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference.  On Accuracy: The components of this rubric each require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, the essay may contain errors that do not detract from the overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate.  On Clarity: These essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge and skills described above.     Scoring Notes  Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. Where no student example of a particular type was found, a hypothetical example was used instead.  A. Thesis and Argument Development (2 points)  a) Thesis Responses earn one point by presenting a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim that responds to all parts of the question (1 point). While the thesis does not need to be a single sentence, it does need to be discrete, meaning it cannot be pieced together from across multiple places within the essay. It can be located in either the introduction or the conclusion, but not split between the two. An acceptable thesis must take a position on whether Bismarck’s rule was either a traditional or new kind of conservatism, as well as provide reason(s) for this assessment. Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Examples of acceptable theses:  • “Essentially, von Bismarck’s government policies represented a new kind of conservatism in nineteenth-century Europe in which he valued traditional ways but also pushed for open-minded, idealistic reforms that were aligned with socialism and helped the nation as a whole.” • “Otto von Bismarck’s government embodied the new conservatism, as he advocated for workers’ rights, religious equality, and socialized education systems. His new form of government was criticized on both sides of the spectrum. Traditional conservatives accused him of being a socialist, while socialist argued he was not liberal enough.” Examples of unacceptable theses:  • This attempt does not work because it does not argue that Bismarck’s governmental policies represent traditional conservatism or a new kind of conservatism: “During Otto von Bismarck’s time as the head of State in Germany during the late 80s to the early 90s, he was well-known for his advocacy of social security for the poor on the basis of a government’s responsibility to its people even though it was not so widely popular with the more conservative people.”  • The thesis attempts to take a position, but its explanation of Bismarck’s policies relating to conservatism is muddled and unclear: “Otto von Bismarck’s government represented new conservatism in nineteenth century Europe. It represented new conservatism because the policies were not finished, because differences in opinion were not yet established, and because had just begun his secularization of the government.”    b) Argument Development Responses must move beyond a single sentence or a listing of facts in support of the thesis or argument; they must explain the relationship of historical evidence to a complex and cohesive thesis or argument and do so throughout a substantial portion of the essay (1 point). Evidence can be related to the argument in ways such as contradiction (e.g., using evidence to address a possible counterargument to the main argument in the essay), corroboration (e.g., combining multiple pieces of evidence to support a single argument), or qualification (e.g., use of evidence to present an argument that is subsequently made more complex by noting exceptions).  Unacceptable argument development would include: • Responses that do not develop a cohesive argument • Responses that simply repeat the content of the documents or list the documents in order • Responses that fail to organize documents in any meaningful way • Responses that do not reconnect the evidence back to a thesis or argument Examples of acceptable argument development:  • The response states that Bismarck’s policies reflect a new conservatism because of his separation of state and church. It then demonstrates complexity of argument by using evidence from Documents 1 and 3 to qualify that point, discussing the formulation of religious policy by the state and the state’s power over the Church and education for the purpose of promoting national identity.   Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  • In a paragraph concerning Bismarck’s political strategy, the response emphasizes his willingness to compromise with certain political groups in order to defeat rival political groups. It draws on corroborating analyses of Documents 5 and 6 as evidence of Bismarck’s desire to avoid revolution.  • To critique Bismarck’s practice of shifting policies when it suited the interests of appealing to differing political parties or groups, the response creates a complex and cohesive treatment of Documents 4 (the cartoon) and 7 (the newspaper article celebrating Bismarck’s dismissal). Examples of unacceptable argument development: • Response refers to both traditional and new conservatism but never clarifies what these terms involve with evidence from the documents in support of a cohesive argument.  • Response discusses Bismarck’s policies but fails to link this discussion to an argument that Bismarck was more of a traditional than a new kind of conservative. • Response makes multiple errors in interpreting documents (e.g., “Document 3 shows that Bismarck knew how to appeal to a mass audience…”), which prohibits their successful use as evidence of an argument. B. Document Analysis (2 points)  a) Document Content Responses earn one point by utilizing the content of at least six of the documents to support the stated thesis or a relevant argument (1 point). Responses cannot earn a point by merely quoting or paraphrasing the documents with no connection to a thesis or argument.   Examples of acceptable utilization of content from a document to support a thesis or relevant argument:  • For Document 1 (Laws in Germany): “In 1869 and 1872 [Bismarck] passed laws granting freedoms of religion and granting access to citizenship, rights, and political offices, and education to all religions (Document 1). Bismarck instituted policies to bolster support for his regime as chancellor.” • For Document 2 (Liebknecht speech): “Liebknecht, a socialist, expressed frustration with how Bismarck suspended freedom of the press, ended campaigns and imprisoned targets to prevent social democrats from holding office in the Reichstag.” • For Document 3 (Wagener memo): “Hermann Wagener, a supporter and aide to Bismarck, notes that ‘the army will only be completely reliable if the workers … are won over and bound to the idea of the Reich,’ which illustrates the importance of nationalism and institutions to maintain order. The army is essential for a nation to garner respect and legitimacy and only through an army can completely in support of the values of a nation is that possible.” • For Document 4 (Political cartoon): “Document 4 shows Bismarck giving favor in turn to Liberal, Conservative, and Ultramontane parties. This flexibility, ensuring no party got the upper hand, was essential to Bismarck’s maintenance of his new conservatism. Rather than simply favoring only Conservatives, as a traditional conservatist would, Bismarck balances all 3 parties.”    Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  • For Document 5 (Kaiser speech): “[Bismarck] also even decided to insure ‘workers against industrial accidents’ (Document 5). Through his perspective, he was not playing nice, but like many of the past, he was playing realpolitik. By alleviating the concerns of the workers, anti-Socialist laws could be passed. As a result, the traditional order was preserved.”  • For Document 6: (Bismarck speech): “Bismarck, who argued that the state had a ‘duty’ to provide aid to ‘its helpless fellow citizens,’ (Document 6) did so not out of the realpolitik view that “lasting guarantees of internal peace” could occur …” • For Document 7 (Richter editorial): “In this article he openly criticizes Bismarck for promoting socialist ideas, but going against the socialist party. Richter described it as ‘offering the carrot one moment and applying the stick the next.’ This Document further expresses the belief that Bismarck wasn’t a traditional conservative at all, and had very socialist ideologies, but still identified as a conservative.” Examples of unacceptable utilization of content from a document to support a thesis or relevant argument: • Beyond the misinterpretation of the document, the response does not clearly connect the document to a position on Bismarck’s policies supporting either traditional or new conservatism: “Wagener [Document 3] seems to be trying to influence Bismarck to pick a side, and stop bouncing between conservatism and socialism. The Document seems to be criticizing Bismarck and even blaming him for the army not being fully reliable.”  • Not only does the response misunderstand the document’s content and purpose, the interpretation of the document lacks coherence in explaining how it does or does not support new conservatism: “In document 2, Wilhelm Liebknecht made the point that there was “no possibility of [their] having an influence on legislation.” A more traditional conservative would already have secret meetings for those who did not agree with the ruler. By the existence of such meetings, the ruler is influenced. Yet, this new conservatism was able to keep meetings from happening by “dissolv[ing] their rights to meet.”   b) Significance of Point of View, Purpose, Context, and/or Audience:  Responses earn one point by explaining the significance of the author’s point of view, author’s purpose, historical context, and/or audience for at least four documents (1 point). (See the document summaries section for description of point of view, purpose, historical context, and audience for each document.)  Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s point of view:  • For Document 7: “Even though Richter was heavily biased against Bismarck, because he was a liberal, these words rang true for all, including socialists and the ultramontane party, because Bismarck repressed them just the same as liberals.” Example of unacceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s point of view: • For Document 1: “Since Bismarck wrote these laws, they would not hold any bias.” (This attempt provides no explanation for how and why the laws might be biased.)   Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s purpose: • For Document 4: “However, one should be careful in using this as a measure of how far Bismarck was willing to go as it comes from a German satirical magazine which can often use exaggeration to improve the point being made.” Example of unacceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s purpose: • For Document 2: “The author of Document 2 is a socialist, however, so he most likely is exaggerating in order to win sympathy for his speech.” (No explanation is provided as to how and why a socialist may engage in exaggeration, e.g., for being oppressed by the government.) Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the historical context of a document: • For Document 6: “Bismarck was alive to see the radical socialist Paris Commune take control, and was likely scared of a similar occurrence in Germany. Thus, he made ‘a serious effort to better conditions for the workers.’”  Example of unacceptable explanation of the significance of the historical context of a document: • For Document 1: “This religious toleration makes sense for Bismarck’s policy within Germany because he had witnessed failure in his suppression of religious groups through his Kulturkampf.” (The law referenced [from 1869] occurred before the failure of the Kulturkampf, thus rendering the analysis chronologically erroneous.)  Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the audience: • For Document 5: “The Kaiser undoubtedly intended for his speech to be heard most importantly by the disillusioned working class. While they had previously been neglected and exploited by forces like modernization, the working class was now being newly emphasized.” Example of unacceptable explanation of the significance of the audience: • For Document 4: “In the cartoon, the magazine pokes fun at Bismarck’s constant shifts in policy to support different political perspectives, whether Liberal, Conservative, or Ultramontane. The audience for this image was the German people.” (Although the statement may correctly identify the intended audience, there is no analysis to support how this fact affected the content or presentation of the document.)  C. Using Evidence Beyond the Documents (2 points)  a) Contextualization Responses earn a point for contextualization by explaining the broader historical events, developments, or processes immediately relevant to the question (1 point). To earn the point, the essay must situate the thesis, argument, or parts of the argument by accurately and explicitly evaluating whether Bismarck’s policies represented a new or traditional type of conservatism. Examples might include:  • Social insurance legislation • Pensions • Anti-Catholic and Anti-Semitic policies • Support for the monarchy • 1848 and its effect on Bismarck Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  • Great power rivalries • Anti-Socialist laws • Growth of political parties in Germany such as Socialist party, known as the Social Democratic Party SPD • German unification • Prussian militarism • Growth of Marxism as ideology • Prussian Junker class Example of acceptable contextualization: • “Traditional conservatism was long a powerful force in European politics. At the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the entrenched rulers of Europe gathered to reaffirm principles like legitimacy and the balance of power. Great effort was exerted to maintain the order of things as they had always been. As nationalism grew in potency with the revolts like those of 1830 and 1848, governments shifted their focus from preserving the overall state of things to preserving their own stability.” Example of unacceptable contextualization: • The response’s references to a “difficult time” and “political unrest” are too general and do not help in setting up the thesis: “Otto von Bismarck was the chancellor of Germany. He held a lot of influence over much of Europe in his attempts to unify some countries. Bismarck ruled during a difficult time, there was much political unrest and a need for societal improvements.”   b) Evidence Beyond the Documents Responses earn a separate point for providing an example or additional piece of specific evidence beyond those found in the documents to support or qualify the argument (1 point). Example of providing an example or additional piece of specific evidence beyond those found in the documents to support or qualify the argument: • “Bismarck utilized what he called Realpolitik in his policy and diplomacy which allowed him to react to any situation in the most efficient manner for the situation. The agendas of traditional conservatism did not restrict Otto von Bismarck’s policies.”  Example of improperly providing an example or additional piece of specific evidence beyond those found in the documents to support or qualify the argument: • The parenthetical reference to Russia is not developed or specific enough, nor does the response connect it to the stated thesis: “In traditional conservatism, the government and the Church often jockeyed for power in places where the Church and head of state were not the same person (as in Russia).”  Distinguishing contextualization of argument from supporting evidence from outside the documents:  Typically, statements credited as contextualization of argument will be more general statements that place the argument or a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as supporting evidence from outside the documents will typically be more specific details that function as support   Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  for a particular point made in the argument, analogous to the function of evidence drawn from the documents.  D. Synthesis (1 point) Responses earn a point for synthesis by extending their argument in one of three possible ways (1 point).  a) Responses can extend their argument by appropriately connecting their argument as to whether Bismarck was a traditional or new conservative to developments in other times and places (Synthesis proficiency C4). These connections must consist of more than just a phrase or reference.  Example of acceptable synthesis by appropriately connecting the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographic area: • “Bismarck’s conservative policies strengthened the power of central governance in Germany and contributed to the cultivation of a strong sense of national identity. The United States government followed a similar policy when America first gained independence. American government was built on the principle that the power should be vested in the political elite instead of the masses — senators were indirectly elected through state legislators and the president was chosen through the electoral college. An institution like the Reichstag was not truly subject to the will of the people, but rather the political elite.”  Example that did not accurately connect the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographic area: • Though the response refers to subsequent events in Germany, the reference does not specifically explain the link to the question of Bismarck’s conservative policies: “Although it would be the economic crisis following WWI and the Great Depression that would ultimately put the Nazis in power, Bismarck’s conservatist failures elevated religious indifferences and the rise of socialism that would allow the National Socialist Party to stick their foot in the door of the German political landscape.”   b) Responses can extend their argument by appropriately connecting an evaluation of Bismarck’s conservatism to course themes and/or approaches to history that are not the main focus of the question (Synthesis proficiency C5). These connections must consist of more than just a phrase or reference. Responses for this question could earn a point for this type of synthesis for using a theme or approach that is not political history, for example, economic or social history. Example of acceptable synthesis by connecting the argument to different course themes and/or approaches to history that are not the main focus of the question:  • “Religious toleration can be seen throughout history many times as anti-conservative. Famous conservative leaders, such as Ferdinand and Isabella, did things such as the Inquisition, which removed Muslims & Jews from Spain, so there would be a unity of Catholic faith. Bismarck, however, wanted religious toleration. This time period was after the 30 Years War, so because of the Treaty of Westphalia, it is allowed for Calvinists, Lutherans, and Catholics all to be a part of Germany.”    Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Example that did not appropriately connect the argument to course themes and/or approaches to history that are not the main focus of the question: • A response might hypothetically include the following: “This time period was also defined by the Second Industrial Revolution, which allowed Germany to challenge Britain as a leading industrial power. However, the advances in industry also created many social problems, like overcrowded cities and new social classes.” Though accurate, this additional approach of economics is not linked in any way to the topic of Bismarck’s policies or conservatism.  c) Responses can extend their argument by using insights from a different discipline or field of inquiry (e.g., economics, government and politics, art history, anthropology) to better understand a given historical issue (Synthesis proficiency C6). These connections must consist of more than just a phrase or reference.  Example of acceptable synthesis by connecting the argument to different disciplines or fields of inquiry: • A response might hypothetically include: “Bismarck’s appeal, along with that of the Kaiser, by using traditional language of God and charity in a paternalistic way, would have a tremendous psychological impact on many Germans raised in a Protestant traditional religious society. These appeals were designed to appeal to the innate conservative desire for order and security in an age of change.”  Example that did not appropriately connect the argument to different disciplines or fields of inquiry: • A response might hypothetically include: “The Bismarck cartoon in document four is an example of the use of mass media as propaganda. Using images like this, new conservatives like Bismarck could manipulate the growing reading public.” This is an attempt to use media studies/sociology to argue that Bismarck was a new conservative but fundamentally misreads the purpose and authorship of the document.  Question 2 — Long Essay Question  “Describe and explain significant continuities and changes in attitudes toward and the experiences of European women from the Reformation through the Enlightenment.”  Maximum Possible Points: 6  Please note: • Each point of the rubric is earned independently, e.g., a student could earn the point for synthesis without earning the point for thesis. • Unique evidence from the student response is required to earn each point, e.g., evidence in the student response that qualifies for either of the targeted skill points could not be used to earn the point for thesis.   A. Thesis (1 point) Targeted Skill: Argumentation (E1)  1 point Presents a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim and responds to all parts of the question. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion.  0 points  Does not present a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim and responds to all parts of the question.  —  Is completely blank.  B.

Synthesis (1 point)  Targeted Skill: Synthesis (C4, C5, or C6)  1 point Extends the argument by explaining the connections between the argument and ONE of the following: a) A development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area.  b) A course theme and/or approach to history that is not the focus of the essay (such as political, economic, social, cultural, or intellectual history).  c) A different discipline or field of inquiry.  0 points Does not extend the argument by explaining the connections between the argument and the other areas listed.  —  Is completely blank  Scoring Note: The synthesis point requires an explanation of the connections to different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area, and is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference.  On Accuracy: The components of this rubric each require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, the essay may contain errors that do not detract from the overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate.  On Clarity: These essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge and skills described above.    Scoring Notes  A. Thesis (1 point)   Responses earn one point by presenting a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim that responds to all parts of the question (1 point). While the thesis does not need to be a single sentence, it does need to be discrete, meaning it cannot be pieced together from across multiple places within the essay. It can be located in either the introduction or the conclusion, but not split between the two.  An acceptable thesis would address both continuities and changes in the experiences of and attitudes toward European women while making a historically defensible statement. Students may conflate experiences and attitudes in their thesis statements. Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued)  Examples of acceptable theses: • “From the 16th to the 18th century the women of European society experience some level of overall change in the role of females, although higher-class members felt these changes more than lower class members. And even with these new ideas, the patriarchy continued to suppress women and many governments would not grant civil rights for another few centuries. At the end of the Enlightenment was a new horizon for women in the next century many women would join the work force and take on a new, much bigger role in society with the start of the Industrial Revolution.” • “Women’s lives have often been shaped by the politics of their time. Though women from the Reformation to the Enlightenment were in some cases given better access to education and allowed to influence political discussions, they were still considered inferior to men and confined to roles as wives and mothers.” • “From the Reformation to the Enlightenment, women of Europe were looked upon as fragile, useless, and only good for a house wife. Over time these European women were able to receive some form of education and work, but their roles would always come up short or be postponed.”  Unacceptable examples of theses: • The response only deals with change: o “The time periods from the Reformation to the Enlightenment experienced a shift in society’s views of women. From Luther’s views of women as homemakers to the philosophe’s views of women as equals, the mindset of society reflects a significant change. Women’s roles in society progressed remarkably … by increasing literacy rates, job opportunities, and political opinion.” • The response is vague, especially regarding change:  o “Throughout time women have never been completely equal to men. The reformation through the Enlightenment is no different. Through this time, women were thought to be less of a human than men were. Between the time of reformation and Enlightenment the people continued to think of women as less important, but women started fighting back.” • The response is essentially a restatement of the prompt: o “The role of women in the era between the Reformation [1517] and the Enlightenment changed gradually. While the attitude toward women has changed much has also stayed the same as activists, even today, try to reform the world view of women.”   B. Argument Development: Using The Targeted Historical Thinking Skill (2 points)   a)  Argument Development — Describes   Responses earn one point by describing both continuities and changes in the experiences of and attitudes toward European women from the Renaissance through the Reformation (1 point).  Example of acceptable description of continuity and change: • “There are some aspects of European women’s lives that change, starting in the Reformation, which gave them more freedoms. With spread of the Protestant faiths, started by Martin Luther and John Calvin, women were able to practice the religion of their choosing. They were seen to be able to worship how they wanted, just like the men of the time. They were also allowed to divorce without consent of the husband, something they couldn’t do in the Renaissance period. Women were also able to limitally [sic] observe the occupations of their husbands. A painting during this time depicts a wife at a table with her husband counting money. Although she was not participating, she was expected and able to understand her husband’s profession. Mary Cavendish   Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued)  was the first women to observe a scientific procedure on a dead man at the Royal society, during the Reformation. This would continue in many centuries opening doors for women.       There are some aspects of European women’s lives that stayed the same, such as still limiting their political position. Although later pushed by Emily Pankhurst, women still into the Reformation and Enlightenment were not allowed to vote or hold any political or religious office. Furthermore, women were still primarily confined to work in the home. It was their said duty to adequately take care of the household.”  Example of unacceptable descriptions of continuity and change: •  Responses might be vague, lacking meaningful description and support for the thesis or argument. o “Women are extremely capable smart human beings that for sadly many many years were only good for being a mother and a wife. During the Reformation feminists began to speak up. They began to speak their minds. Women were not able to vote, work, they were merely there to cook and clean.      During the reformation Martin Luther wrote about how Christian women should be. How they should act and what they should wear and how they should behave. Feminists were not fond of that. After all the things feminists had spoken up about and after women suffrage came the enlightenment.       The enlightenment was a better time for women. They still had little rights and were mistreated. But they were now able to work. Lots of women became teachers or helped with farms. People were beginning to become enlightened and things were shaping up for women.”  b) Argument Development — Explains   Responses can earn the point here by explaining both continuities and changes in the experiences of and attitudes toward European women (1 point).  Example of acceptable explanation of reasons for continuities and changes:  • “In the Protestant Reformation, many things were changing. Nobles were turning to Protestantism and Luther shamelessly attacked indulgences. However, the only change of attitude regarding women went backwards. The Catholics believed that despite women still being inferior to men, women had the choice of being independent and serving as nuns. The Protestants, however, believed that women must stay at home and care for children as housewives. However, throughout the years [emerged] the Enlightenment, an era of reason and secularization. Women of high class were now increasingly exposed to education and (however unrelated to women’s rights but rather seen as a ‘tedious’ job for upperclass women) their children were taken care of by maids as well. There was a change in attitude in that women didn’t have to purely focus on housework and children if you were of [the] upper-class.         However, despite this small change in mindset, this did little to nothing to change the major attitude toward women. Even those of the Enlightenment such as Voltaire ... thought that women were still inferior. There were no major or minor events that truly changed the attitude towards women, from Luther to Voltaire. Even though upper class women were given education, this meant practically nothing considering the upper class consisted of barely 3% of the entire European population. All in all, the attitude believing women were inferior to men hardly changed.”  Example of unacceptable explanation of reasons for continuities and changes: • Responses might only describe change while not describing continuity, or vice versa. o       “Martin Luther sparked the Protestant Reformation during the 16th century. Despite his reforms to the Catholic Church, Luther still held the belief that women did not have a place in  Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued)  the Church. His elimination of monastic [life] took away from females’ option of becoming a nun in protestant areas. Some more radical Protestant divisions believed that women could read the bible [sic] and even preach. This provided women with a new role in Church life. Since the Bible was regarded as the only Christian text in Lutheranism, literacy rates were increasing so that people were able to read the bible [sic], and this included women. This meant that women were starting to become more educated …      During the time of the Enlightenment many philosophes developed the concept of ‘natural rights’ which included right to religion, speech, and other means of attaining happiness. Most of these thinkers only applied the concept of these rights to the male gender. Mary Wollenstonecraft [sic] and her ‘Vindication for the Rights of Women’ displayed the change that women wished to see at this time. Many men disregarded her work.”  C. Argument Development: Using Evidence (2 points)   a) Using Evidence — Examples   Responses can earn one point by addressing the topic of the question by referring to specific examples or relevant evidence (1 point). Essays can earn this point without having a stated thesis or a relevant argument.  Possible examples of specific evidence:  • Christine de Pisan, Les Querelles des Femmes • Isabel d’Este • Castiglione’s The Courtier (traditional views of women) • Patronage • Lutheran Reformation and its influence on the role of women • Katerina von Bora • Calvin’s negative views regarding women • Anabaptists’ allowance of women to preach/minister • Closing of convents • Education • Literacy and the printing press • Catholic women maintained access to convents • Henry VIII (need for a male heir) • Powerful female rulers: Elizabeth I, Mary Tudor, Catherine de Medicis, Mary Stuart  (William and Mary), Maria Theresa, Catherine the Great • Witchcraft trials • Scientific Revolution • Margaret Cavendish, Émilie du Châtelet, Maria Winkelmann (Kirch) • Anatomical evidence of larger hips and smaller skulls   • Art: Artemesia Gentileshci, “Merchants Counting Money,” “The Moneylender” • The putting-out system • Early industrial revolution • Salons: Mme. Geoffrin, etc. • Olympe de Gouges, Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen • Mary Wollstonecraft, Vindication of the Rights of Woman Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued)  • Rousseau’s Émile • March on Versailles • Jacobin clubs • Napoleonic Code  Example of specific evidence that could be used to address the topic of the question:   • “Due to the Protestant Reformation, women’s roles as moral guides and mothers became emphasized. The Protestant Reformation’s emphasis on personal interpretations of the Bible led to increases in literacy among women, as more of them learned to read, to spread scripture to their children and families…       While mothers developed as a symbol of morality of the home, older women, especially widdows [sic], continued to be suspected of witchcraft, and many were put to death without cause. The deaths of these women show the extreme bias against, even suspicion towards women at the time.”  Example of unsuccessfully using evidence to address the topic of the question:  • Evidence that is vague or merely descriptive: o “While the time period changed people’s minds didn’t. Men of higher authority only thought of women as the people who carried babies and did all the house work. They were not given the opportunity to become something to make a change. Every job, whether a manual labor [sic], or a teacher, was provided to a guy and most of those guys would get jobs over women. Education was given to young boys but not young girls. The only position women held was being Queen and that even came with ties attached.”  b) Using Evidence — Effective Substantiation  Responses earn a separate point by utilizing specific examples of evidence to fully and effectively substantiate a thesis or relevant argument addressing continuities and changes in attitudes toward and the experiences of European women from the Reformation through the Enlightenment (1 point). Fully and effectively substantiating the thesis goes beyond merely providing many examples. This point is earned by clearly and consistently linking significant evidence to the argument and showing how the evidence demonstrates continuities and changes in attitudes toward and the experiences of European women.  Examples of evidence that could be utilized to substantiate an argument:  • “In the French Revolution, the Rights of Man and Citizen was written specifically for man. Olympe de Gouges responded with the Declaration of the Rights of Women. In this way it is clear that the misogynistic ideas of the Catholic Restoration continued into the Enlightenment, although Catherine the Great ruled Russia during the Enlightenment.”  • “The experiences of European women first began to change during the Protestant reformation, during which Protestants such as Martin Luther began to argue that anyone could read the Bible for oneself. Although Clerical positions were still exclusively for males, women could now read the Bible themselves, something that had not occurred before the Reformation. In addition, with the invention of the printing press, books became much more common and became easier to obtain, especially the Bible, which was only owned by households that could afford them.“    Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued)  Examples of unsuccessfully attempting to substantiate an argument with evidence:  • The response is no more than a vague, simple description. o “Through the Reformation, things like war went on, while men went out there, doing their thing. Women worked inside either taking care of children working in factories or preparing in the kitchen.” • The response is historically inaccurate, vague, and overly simplistic. o “People began to see that, even though they were still inferior to men, maybe the gap wasn’t quite so big. Just look at Madam Currey.”   • The response is historically flawed or not relevant to the time period. o “Some powerful women in history however brought change to how women were treated and viewed. For example Joan of Arc, a powerful women’s rights advocate died for her rights.”  D. Synthesis (1 point)  Essays earn a point for synthesis by extending their argument in one of three possible ways (1 point).  a)  Responses can extend their argument by explaining the connections between their argument and a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area (Synthesis proficiency C4). These connections must consist of more than just a phrase or reference.  Examples of synthesis by connecting the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area (C4): • “Even today, women are fighting to gain more respect, and even basic human rights. In Pakistan and the middle-east, women are still suppressed by their husbands. In some places, women aren’t even allowed to have access to education. But other women like Malala, are attempting to fix things just like Mary Wollstonecraft was, and improve the situation of women, around the world.” • “As a whole, women struggled to have a significant status in European society throughout the reformation, while Elizabeth I’s valiant leadership of England inspired many and broke barriers for what people thought of women, and women’s education increased through the enlightenment as they began to take a mere active role in society. Increasingly, women’s roles in society led to eventually female suffrage that we see in most countries today not only European. Women are also involved with politics nowadays, with prominent female leaders such as Angela Merkel of Germany ruling to this day.” • “These attitudes towards women can be seen as similar to the much later gay rights movement in Europe. Many, at the time, radicals advocated for gay rights, but not much progress was made. But, like the women’s rights movement, it gradually gained steam and popularity over time. Those separated by nearly a century, both movements were ultimately successfully in major countries in Europe; yet both still have many ways to go in others.”  Examples that did not accurately connect the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area (C4): • The response does not develop adequately a comparison with another historical period o “By the end of the Enlightenment, women seemed to have a bit more of a voice than before. These events can’t be compared to the success of women’s rights being gained in the 20th century, but it was the foundation of women’s freedom.” • The response does not develop adequately developments in a different geographical region. o “However, it was important to note that these trends [religious freedom] often did not extend to Eastern Europeans as they would learn these radically new views still later than those in Western Europe.” Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued)  b) Responses can extend their argument by explaining the connections between their argument and a course theme and/or approach to history that is not the focus of the essay, such as political, economic, social, cultural, or intellectual history (Synthesis proficiency C5). These connections must consist of more than just a phrase or reference.  Example of synthesis by connecting the argument to a different course theme or approach to history (C5): • The response discusses an economic approach in its analysis of change after the Enlightenment. o “Women’s economic role in society changed because of the First Industrial revolution. At first, women worked in cottage industries at home, while their husband worked the fields. Once the First industrial revolution began and families moved to cities, Women’s roles changed. Women were forced to work in either prostitution or in factories because most families could not afford to have women stay at home. This similar working situation in factories between men and women was the first step towards social equality.”  Example that did not accurately connect the argument to a different course theme or approach to history (C5): • The response attempts to use an intellectual approach but does not merely provides evidence instead of extending the argument. o “Next during the Enlightenment, a lot of literature appeared in favor of feminist ideals … Olympia de Gouges was very prominent here, as she led many radical women. She also wrote The Declaration of the Rights of Woman in response to declaration by the National Assembly.”  c) Responses can extend their argument by explaining the connections between their argument and a different discipline or field of inquiry. (Synthesis proficiency C6). These connections must consist of more than just a phrase or reference.    Example of synthesis by connecting the argument to a different discipline or field of inquiry (C6): • The response attempts to use a sociological approach in its analysis of continuities between the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries and the period between the Reformation and Enlightenment. o “The politicization of female inequality can be related to the development of social darwinism. Both made prejudice more official and denied non-white people and women social privileges and respect in European eyes. Furthered, both were perpertrated [sic] by individuals and groups who felt they were doing a service by either “civilizing nonwhites” or “helping women” in their social roles.”  Example that did not accurately connect the argument to a different discipline or field of inquiry (C6): • The response insufficiently supports an extension of the argument about continuities regarding European women: o A student might hypothetically write, “The discrimination against women between the Reformation and the Enlightenment can be seen in the 20th century regarding other groups such as discrimination against Africans for racial reasons.”  Question 3 — Long Essay Question  “Describe and explain significant continuities and changes in attitudes toward and the experiences of European women from the First World War through the Cold War.”   Maximum Possible Points: 6  Please note: • Each point of the rubric is earned independently, e.g., a student could earn the point for synthesis without earning the point for thesis. • Unique evidence from the student response is required to earn each point, e.g., evidence in the student response that qualifies for either of the targeted skill points could not be used to earn the point for thesis.   A.

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge and skills described above.      Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued)  Scoring Notes  A. Thesis (1 point) Responses earn one point by presenting a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim that responds to all parts of the question (1 point). While the thesis does not need to be a single sentence, it does need to be located in one place, either the introduction or the conclusion. It cannot be split between the two.  An acceptable thesis would address both continuities and changes in the experiences of and attitudes toward European women while making a historically defensible statement. In their thesis statements, students may conflate women’s experiences and attitudes towards women. Thesis statements may emphasize change over continuity, but a minimally acceptable thesis must reference both.   Examples of acceptable theses:  • “Within the span of a century, women are able to go from being viewed as inferior to having suffrage and being able to have power in some instances. Though not entirely equal due to residual discrimination, women establish their places in society.” (in conclusion)  • “In the period between World War One and the Cold War, women have gained suffrage and new job opportunities in many countries, however, the significant wars and events between these periods have still not allowed women to receive equal pay as men or to have all the same opportunities as their male counterparts.” (in conclusion) • “The attitudes towards and experiences of women from the First World War to the Cold War changed at women gaining voting rights and the greater opportunity outside the home but stayed the same as they were still seen as inferior and in charge of the domestic sphere.”  • “Throughout history, there have been changing roles for women as well as different attitudes towards them. From World War I to the Cold War, attitudes towards women stayed the same as they were still seen as subordinate to men, but changed in that they gained more rights and opportunities.”  •  “The role of women in Europe has changed many times throughout its history. Above all, the trend follows an up-down pattern with general improvement and then repression but the prominence of women in society and their ability to control their own situation, the degree of demand for women in the workforce and the degree of their participation in politics are the primary factors in attitudes toward and experiences of women.” (mostly change with minimally implied continuity)  Unacceptable examples of theses: • “The time period from WWI to the Cold War signified a shift from European women in the ‘cult of domesticity’ to the creation of occupational and educational opportunities during and prior to the periods of ‘total war.’” (only change, no continuity)  • “Women prior to the first World War had very little power, but as the war moved on, and the world ended with the Cold War, women had gained enough rights to put themselves in the same social standing as men.” (only change, no continuity).  • “From the beginning of time, women for some reason have always been treated as inferiors to men. They were not allowed to have jobs, vote, or allowed to do many other things in society. In the 20th century, things began to change for women. Attitudes towards women changed from WWI to the Cold War because of situations during the period and their extreme efforts to change men’s views on them.” (only change, elaborate restating of prompt).    Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued)  B. Argument Development: Using The Targeted Historical Thinking Skill (2 points)   a) Argument Development — Describes   Responses earn one point by describing the continuities and changes in the experiences of and attitudes toward European women from the First World War through the Cold War (1 point).  This point is a descriptive task. To earn this point, responses must provide at least one change AND at least one continuity.   Examples of acceptable descriptions of continuity and change: • “As a result of WWI, many of the men in Europe had gone to fight in the Great War to defend their homelands, thus causing women to fill their jobs left behind. Jobs like building weapons, making military uniforms, and taking care of business left behind by men. When World War I ended, the men came back and took back spots on jobs, taking them back from the women. However many men had died in the war, leaving the women with some of the jobs.”  • “Many women at the beginning of the Cold War period were still a part of the work force but many were forced back into the domestic sphere. The attitude had shifted back into a male dominated society. It slowly began shifting back into feminist ideology at the end of the Cold War.”  • “Though women were beginning to work outside the home and get an education, they were also still expected to be in charge of the children and keeping the house clean.”   Examples of unacceptable descriptions of continuity and change: • “Women were treated better in Europe during WWI because women were needed to fill in jobs while the men were fighting in WWI as well as in WWII. They helped the European countries out a lot economically, since there were many unfilled jobs.” (describes only change) • “As technology and medicine developed, birth control pills were developed. This helped women with husbands control when to have birth and helped them be able to work in the workforce instead of staying at home to take care of kids.” (describes only change)  We have not seen examples that address only continuity.   b) Argument Development — Explains   Responses can earn the point here by explaining continuities and changes in the experiences of and attitudes towards European women (1 point).  To earn this point, responses must move beyond mere description and must show why at least one continuity AND one change occurred. It is possible for a student to earn this second point of 3B without earning the (descriptive) first part.   Examples of acceptable explanations of reasons for continuities and changes:  • “In the first World War, as more and more men were sent off to die in trenches, most European countries ran out of male labor sources and began to draw women into blue collar work. Prior to this, they had only held ‘pink collar’ jobs, such as teachers, nurses, and telephone/telegraph operators. While this experience in the workforce (where they earned and often still earned less than men), did lead to an empowered feminist movement, resulting in female suffrage in several European countries, the vast majority of women returned to ‘domestic life’ and remained second class citizens.”    Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued)  • “As higher secondary education became more available, many women embraced the opportunity and learned new skills which was put into the workforce. Professions such as nursing became increasingly women dominant and fewer women stayed in the domestic sphere. All views of women were not changed, though, and women were expected to still be in charge of the domestic sphere as well as work outside the home and still did not have the same opportunities as men.”  • “From World War I to the Cold War, many things changed for women. Before and during WWI, they had limited opportunities to get a job. They did not have equal rights to men and could not vote. There was a women’s suffrage movement, but it did not gain rights for women until after WWII. In the early 1900s, there were very few professions seen as acceptable for women. They were expected to get married, stay home, and take care of the kids while the husband earns money. The wife was expected to cook, clean the house, and make the husband comfortable when he got home. However, during WWI, there was a growing need for women. They were needed to make supplies for the soldiers and be nurses. Their role in the war led them to receive voting rights shortly after WWI. After this, women were seen as more equal to men.”  Examples of unacceptable explanation of reasons for continuities and changes: • “Women also used this time to attempt to gain rights for themselves. This started many feminist movements across Europe. The wars gave women the ability to unite and fight for rights that were restricted from them.” (only change, provides no explanation)  • “Now we’re in the time between WWI and the Cold War. At this time, women are still taking over while the men are gone in order to maintain a living for their families. Then, WWII came to an end, and the men came back, and they demanded their jobs back, but the women didn’t budge.” (historically-inaccurate attempt at explanation)  • “At first, the women were just happy that their husbands, brothers, or whoever fought, came back. But as time went on, their kids starting going to school, and there is only so much time you can spend cleaning, so women got bored. They had nothing to do all day while their kids were learning and their husbands were working.” (confuses causality over different time periods)   C. Argument Development: Using Evidence (2 Points)  a)  Using Evidence — Examples   Responses can earn one point by addressing the topic of the question by referring to specific examples or relevant evidence (1 point). Essays can earn this point without having a stated thesis or a relevant argument. To earn this point essays must provide two or more specifically European examples. Examples can be related to either change OR continuity and need not be related to both to earn this point.  Examples of specific evidence that could be used to address the topic of the question:  • Suffrage • Birth control/abortion • Women in military: nursing, combat  • Divorce • Margaret Thatcher • Simone de Beauvoir Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued)  • Employment opportunities/inequality/wage inequality/”glass ceiling” • Education • Property rights • Feminism (Second and Third Wave) • State policies toward women (fascist, Nazi, Soviet) • Unrest and student revolts of 1968  Note: references to earlier developments, especially as they relate to suffrage (Finland, Pankhurst, Wollstonecraft) are acceptable if they are related to developments within the time period specified in the question.   Examples of unsuccessfully using evidence to address the topic of the question:       •    “Even with the right to vote, [women] could not hold office.” (factually incorrect) • “Some women, such as the elected prime minister of Britain, Margaret Thatcher, even gained high political positions during the WW2 period.” (chronologically incorrect) • “Towards the beginning of WW2, women received more job positions due to reforms and not wanting more fighting. Not only that, but they were also paid the correct equal amount as men.” (factually incorrect) • “After the wars, women began to realize that they had way less rights than men. Betty Freidan restarted this movement again, but under a different name. Her women’s liberation movement followed the questions she asked in her book The Feminine Mystique.” (American example but, in context, not connected to European developments)   b)  Using Evidence — Effective Substantiation  Responses earn a separate point by utilizing specific examples of evidence to fully and effectively substantiate a thesis or relevant argument addressing continuities and changes in attitudes toward and the experiences of European women from the First World War through the Cold War (1 point). Fully and effectively substantiating the thesis goes beyond merely providing two or more examples, which may address only continuity or change. This point is earned by clearly and consistently linking significant evidence to the argument and showing how the evidence demonstrates continuities and changes in attitudes toward and the experiences of European women.  Examples of evidence that could be utilized to substantiate an argument:  • “People’s views of women as far as being mothers and wives continued throughout the period between World War One and the Cold War. In Germany for example, Aryan women were encouraged to stay at home and be mothers to little blond-haired, blue-eyed kids during WWII.”   • “Women began to become more aware of and fight for their rights, changing their experiences during this time. In Russia, however, the complete opposite happened. Lenin originally made many women’s parties to encourage education for women and loyalty to the state. However, Stalin revoked these policies and forced women into the domestic sphere, demonstrating the decrease instead of increase in women’s rights.”   • “As the war persisted, women were expected to join the workforce during the time of total war to help in factories and other industries. After the war, women were expected to go back to their domestic jobs and give up their high-income jobs to men. In order to reward the women for their dedication during war, counties like Britain gave women over the age of 30 the right to vote in 1918.”   Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued)  Examples of unsuccessfully attempting to substantiate an argument with evidence:  • “England under Margaret Thatcher gave women the right to divorce and more civil liberties like owning properties. These ideas spread throughout Europe and even rock music, a new genre popular in the 50s, spread ideas of gender equality.” (indefensible claim; cannot count as evidence)  • “During Cold wartimes, women had realized their need to push for rights that had so long been ignored. Many Western women’s rights activists (feminists, as some would later be called, from the French word), based arguments on the suffering of women, especially in the Soviet Bloc (sphere of influence).” (conflates causality)   D. Synthesis (1 point)  Essays earn a point for synthesis by extending an argument in one of three possible ways, as described below (1 point). Synthesis does not necessarily have to appear at the end of the essay; it can appear anywhere in the body. Regardless of the particular type, the response must consist of more than a brief phrase or reference (“This is like …” without explanation does not suffice).  a) Responses can extend an argument by explaining its connections to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area (Synthesis proficiency C4). This may be the most commonly-used synthesis for this particular essay.  Examples of synthesis by connecting the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area (C4): • Furthering the argument that female candidates seeking public office such as Margaret Thatcher had to act masculine in order to confront widespread discrimination against women, the response reads: “A situation similar to this is how Queen Elizabeth the First of England was forced to act strong, powerful, and independent in the face of her enemies and her friends in order to win over the English people and garner their loyalty. Because of discrimination, a Queen Elizabeth I that represented feminine qualities would never win over the English people.”  • “The development of [women’s] rights is similar to the African [Americans] and their struggle for equality. Despite stubborn religious beliefs and misunderstood science that categorized them as inferior, just like the former slaves, women believed in basic human equality that did not hail the white men as superior. And through the horrendous impact of the war opened the eyes of man and made him see society in a new light. Such development continues to the modern day, with the most powerful person in Germany, a woman, Angela Merkel, and a rising member of the extreme right in France, Marine Le Pen, to have power traditionally granted to men.”   • “The changes in attitude towards women during the twentieth century is similar to the changes witnessed during the Reformation and Enlightenment. Similarly, during that time period, women gained a lot of respect as Enlightenment thinkers such as Mary Wollstonecraft argued for equal opportunities for women through education. This was vastly different from the Reformation attitudes that looked down on women, as could be seen in the witchcraft craze that targeted women and burned them at the stake.”    Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued)  Examples that did not accurately connect the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area (C4): • In support of the argument that, despite gaining the right to vote, “women are still thought to be inferior”: “Something similar to this is when men were judged on land. Men without land were thought to be inferior. They later gained more rights like the right to vote. Men with land were thought to be better and more employed.” (vague and unsupported reference)  • “In years before, women were frowned upon if they were caught doing something else that was not in their status. For example, during the Middle Ages, women were placed in brothels because they were seen as toys by society. Fortunately, the brothels were demolished later on, but it did not take away the humiliation that women took, because if they didn’t, society would shun them out.” (factually incorrect)   b) Responses can extend an argument by connecting it to a course theme and/or approach to history that is not the focus of the essay (such as political, economic, social, cultural, or intellectual history) (Synthesis proficiency C5).  Example of synthesis by connecting the argument to a different course theme or approach to history (C5): • “After the war ended, women kept this ability to work as a forced right. This led to a massive increase in the supply of labor which in turn allowed for more economic growth and development as when the supply of labor goes up, the wages go down.” (Note: this was at the end of a paragraph in the middle of the essay.)  Example that did not accurately connect the argument to a different course theme or approach to history (C5): • As part of an argument that Western European feminism originated in response to women’s rights obtained in Russia during the First World War: “Communism, by abolishing social and economic classes, changed the lives of women. Now women were no longer bourgeois, but proletariat in the Soviet Union and later Eastern Europe.” (unsuccessful attempt to use Marxist-Leninist approach)  c) Responses can extend an argument by connecting it to a different discipline or field of inquiry (Synthesis proficiency C6).  Example of synthesis by connecting the argument to a different discipline or field of inquiry (C6): • “The changes and continuities of women’s experiences can also be seen in art from the twentieth century. Although Rosie the Riveter encouraged women to work, later newspaper ads and commercials sold items that would allow women to become good housewives. However, after women fought for their rights, commercials stopped focusing on women being good housewives and encouraged their education and jobs. Andy Warhol’s Marilyn Monroe shows a female actress smoking, which goes against traditional housewife ideas.” (American visual culture and art history)  Example that did not accurately connect the argument to a different course theme or approach to history (C6): • “The development of the birth control pill upended the natural order that had been around since the times of cavemen.” (unsupported biological claim)          AP® European History 2016 Scoring Guidelines      © 2016 The College Board.
