Has an acceptable thesis 1 Thesis must be explicit, based on one or more documents. It may not be a simple rewording of the question or of the historical background. Students may conflate the two terms used in the question, character and condition, or use them implicitly. Thesis may appear at the end. 2. Uses a majority of documents 1 Uses at least six documents by reference to anything in the box, even if used incorrectly. (The map is not a document.) They need not be cited by number or name. 3. Supports thesis or answers question with appropriate evidence from the documents  1 NOTE: Even when there is no thesis, the essay can still offer evidence from the documents relating to issues of Greek conditions and character, earning a point. Only one document need be used to discuss a view. Must discuss three views of character and condition of the Greeks. May discuss character and condition implicitly or explicitly, separately or together. Discussions of views of Turks are relevant only if they reveal views about Greeks. Some general categories of views: • Greeks are decayed, in ruins, weak • Greeks are brigands, drunkards, hooligans, devious • Greeks are heroes or potentially heroic • Greeks main problem is the Turks  • Greeks are defenders of Christianity • Pro-Greek • Critical of Greeks • Ambivalent or neutral Documents 1, 4, 5 2, 5, 9 7, 8, 10, 11 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 8, 10, 11 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 4, 5, 9 2, 8 4. Understands the basic meaning of the documents cited in the essay 1 Must use at least four documents correctly. May misinterpret the content of no more than one document; a major misinterpretation is one that leads to an inaccurate grouping or a false conclusion. 5. Analyzes bias or point of view in at least three documents (or POV/ bias in one 1 document with consistent attribution) • Relates authorial point of view to authors place politically and/or by nationality OR • Evaluates the reliability of the source OR • Recognizes that different kinds of documents serve different purposes OR • Analyzes tone or intent of documents  OR analyzes POV or bias in one document and gives consistent attribution Copyright © 2001 by College Entrance Examination Board.
