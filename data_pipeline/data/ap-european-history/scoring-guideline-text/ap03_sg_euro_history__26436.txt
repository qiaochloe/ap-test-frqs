Understands the basic meaning of the documents cited in the essay. Must use at least four documents correctly.  May make a major misinterpretation ofno more than one document; a major misinterpretation is one that leads to an inaccurate grouping or a false analysis. Consistent small errors = one major error.

In this DBQ consistent attribution will not be accepted for POV. 6. Analyzes documents by grouping them in at least two groups.  A group must have at least three docs. Sub-groups within a larger grouping are acceptable. A fallacious grouping receives no credit. Examples of possible groups include: 1, 2, 9,10. Pétain himself. 1, 2, 6, 8, 9. Pro-Vichy. 3, 4, 5, 7.
