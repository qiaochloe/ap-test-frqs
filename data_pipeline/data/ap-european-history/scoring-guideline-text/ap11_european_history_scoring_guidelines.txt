Provides an appropriate, explicitly stated thesis that directly addresses all parts of the question. Thesis must not simply restate the question. The thesis must address at least one idea about gender with some degree of specificity (e.g., “Most believed that women were inferior to men”; “It was against God’s wishes for women to rule”). The thesis must also include reference to or mention of Elizabeth’s response. The thesis need not appear in the first paragraph; it may be found in the conclusion.  2. Discusses a majority of the documents individually and specifically. The essay must discuss at least seven documents — even if used incorrectly — by reference to anything in the box. For an essay to receive credit for this point, documents may not be referenced collectively (e.g., “Documents 2, 3 and 6 suggest …”) unless they are then discussed individually.  3. Demonstrates understanding of the basic meaning of a majority of the documents (may misinterpret no more than one). The essay may not significantly misinterpret more than one document. A major misinterpretation is an incorrect analysis or one that leads to an inaccurate grouping.  4. Supports the thesis with appropriate interpretations of a majority of the documents. The essay must use at least seven documents correctly, and the documents used in the body of the essay must provide support for the thesis. The essay cannot earn this point if no credit was awarded for point 1 (appropriate thesis).  5. Analyzes point of view or bias in at least three documents. The essay must make a reasonable effort to explain why a particular source expresses the stated view by • relating authorial point of view to the author’s place in society (motive, position, status, etc.), OR • evaluating the reliability of the source, OR • recognizing that different kinds of documents serve different purposes, OR • analyzing the tone of the documents; must be clear and relevant. Note: 1) Attribution alone is not sufficient to earn credit for point of view.  2) It is possible for students to discuss point of view collectively, but this counts for only one       point of view.      Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  6. Analyzes documents by explicitly organizing them in at least three appropriate groups. A group must contain at least two documents that are used correctly and individually. Groupings and corresponding documents may include the following (not exclusive).  IDEAS • Political institutions: 3, 4, 6, 11  • Political power: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12 • Religious figures: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9 • Marriage/succession: 6, 11 • Misogyny: 1, 2, 5  • Constitutional: 2, 4 • Personal associates: 4, 9, 10, 12  RESPONSES • Authoritative: 6, 8, 11, 12 • Regal: 6, 8, 11, 12 • Marriage/succession: 5, 6, 11, 12 • Propaganda: 8, 9, 11, 12  EXPANDED CORE: 0–3 points to a total of 9 points  Expands beyond the basic core points 1–6 outlined above. The basic score of 6 must be achieved before a student can earn expanded core points. Credit awarded in the expanded core should be based on holistic assessment of the essay. Factors to consider in holistic assessment may include the following:   • Presents a clear, analytical, and comprehensive thesis. • Uses all or almost all the documents (10–12 documents). • Uses the documents persuasively as evidence. • Shows understanding of nuances of the documents. • Analyzes point of view or bias in at least four documents. • Analyzes the documents in additional ways (e.g., develops more groupings). • Recognizes and develops change over time. • Brings in relevant outside information. Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Document Summary  Document 1: John Knox, Scottish religious reformer, First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women, 1558 To promote a Woman to bear rule, superiority, dominion, or empire above any Realm, Nation, or City is against all Nature. … And that the Holy Ghost does manifestly express, saying: “I suffer not a woman to usurp authority above the man.”… So both by God’s law and by the interpretation of the Holy Ghost, women are utterly forbidden to occupy the place of God in the offices aforesaid.  Document 2: Nicholas Heath, archbishop of York, debate before the House of Lords, 1558 To preach or minister the holy sacraments, a woman may not. … A woman in the degrees of Christ’s church is not called to be an apostle, nor evangelist, nor to be a shepherd, neither a doctor nor preacher. Therefore her Highness [Elizabeth I] cannot be supreme head of Christ’s militant church, nor yet of any part thereof.  Document 3: Parliament of England, Act of Supremacy, 1559 The queen’s highness is the only supreme governor of this realm and of all other her highness’s dominions and countries, as well in all spiritual or ecclesiastical things or causes as temporal, and no foreign prince, person, prelate, state, or potentate hath or ought to have any jurisdiction, power, superiority, preeminence, or authority, ecclesiastical or spiritual, within this realm.  Document 4: John Aylmer, friend of Elizabeth I’s tutor, pamphlet, 1559 To be sure, if [Elizabeth] were a mere monarch and not a mixed ruler, you might peradventure make me fear the matter the more, and the less to defend the cause. But in England it is not so dangerous a matter to have a woman ruler.  Document 5: The Second Book of Homilies, produced by bishops of the Church of England, authorized by Elizabeth I, 1562 The husband ought to be the leader and author of love in cherishing and increasing concord. … But as for wives, they must obey their husbands and cease from commanding, and perform subjection.   Document 6: Jacques Bochetel de La Forest, French ambassador to England, report on Elizabeth I’s response to a proposed parliamentary petition on the succession question, 1566 What they asked her to do was nothing less than wishing her to dig her grave before she was dead. [Then,] addressing herself to the Lords, she said: “My Lords, do what you will. As for myself, I shall do nothing but according to my pleasure. All the resolutions which you may make have no force without my consent and authority. … I will take counsel with men who understand justice and the laws, as I am deliberating to do.” On this she dismissed them in great anger.  Document 7: Edward Rishton, Roman Catholic priest, On the Origin and Growth of the English Schism, 1585 And to show the greater contempt for our Blessed lady [the Virgin Mary], they keep the birthday of Queen Elizabeth in the most solemn way on the seventh day of September, which is the eve of the feast of the Mother of God, whose nativity they mark in their calendar in small and black letters, while that of Elizabeth is marked in letters both large and red.     Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Document Summary (continued)  Document 8: Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger, English court painter, portrait of Elizabeth I standing on a map of England, 1592  Document 9: William Tooker, personal chaplain of Elizabeth I, describing a “touching” ceremony, 1597 How often have I seen her most serene Majesty, prostrate on her knees, body and soul rapt in prayer … how often have I seen her with her exquisite hands, whiter than whitest snow, boldly and without disgust, pressing their sores and ulcers, and handling them to health … how often have I seen her worn with fatigue, as when in one single day, she healed eight and thirty persons of the struma.  Document 10: William Clowes, personal surgeon of Elizabeth I, treatise, 1602 Let us all continually pray unto Almighty God to grant [Elizabeth] long life, much happiness, peace and tranquility; that he will bless, keep and defend her Sacred person from the malice of her known and unknown enemies, so that she may forever reign over us.  Document 11: Elizabeth I, speech to Parliament delivered in 1559, recorded in an official history of her reign, first published in 1615 But now that the public care of governing the kingdom is laid upon me, to draw upon me also the cares of marriage may seem a point of inconsiderate folly. Yea, to satisfy you, I have already joined myself in marriage to an husband, namely, the Kingdom of England.  Document 12: Elizabeth I, speech to English troops delivered in 1588 before the attempted invasion of the Spanish Armada, recorded in a letter by an eyewitness, 1623  I have placed my chiefest strength and safeguard in the loyal hearts and good will of my subjects. I know I have but the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king. I myself will be your general, judge and rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field. Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  A Closer Look at Point of View  There are many means by which a student can demonstrate point-of-view analysis in the DBQ.   Examples of ACCEPTABLE Point-of-View Analysis  Relating authorial point of view to author’s place in society  1. “Bishops of the Church of England, who would have naturally opposed the progression of gender equality due to their affiliation with the conservative Church, wrote, ‘Wives … must obey their husbands and cease from commanding’” (document 5).  2. “Members of the clergy, for example, John Knox, a religious reformer, went so far as to title a book, First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women. In his book, Riston, a Roman Catholic priest, displeased about the changing views of the Virgin Mary in England, openly criticized Elizabeth for demoting Mary in importance. Also the Archbishop of York argued that women cannot hold clerical titles and therefore can never be head of the Church of England. However, all of these negative attitudes and criticisms come from clergy who, as a group, tend to be conservative” (documents 1, 2, 7 — counts as one POV).   3. “One must keep in mind that Bochetel was French and due to the long standing animosity between the two nations, may have simply been eager for the anticipated turmoil which would weaken England” (document 6).  Evaluating the reliability of the source  1. “Aylmer’s opinion could be related to his friendship with the Queen’s tutor, and may cause him to defend her, rather than look at her rule objectively” (document 4).  2. “Elizabeth’s personal surgeon, William Clowes, supports her rule and prays for a long life for her. His relationship with Elizabeth could influence with his judgment about her success as a ruler” (document 10).  3. “As William Tooker, Elizabeth’s personal chaplain, describes about a ‘touching ceremony’ in 1597, one can clearly see that she commanded and got respect on a personal level, not just for being Queen. Although supportive, it is similarly biased for one of Elizabeth’s closest subjects to be in such admiration of her” (document 9).  Recognizing that different kinds of documents serve different purposes  1. “Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger, an English court painter, would have collaborated with Elizabeth in creating her portrait, standing on a map of England, to present her as regal and powerful to those who aimed at discrediting her” (document 8).  Analyzing the tone of the documents  1. “Jacques Bochetel de la Forest from France seemed to approve. He reports, in what can only be taken for an amused tone, of her response to parliament” (document 6).  Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  A Closer Look at Point of View (continued)  Examples of UNACCEPTABLE Point-of-View Analysis  1. “This document is biased because the speaker shows only one point of view for the idea of women rulers” (document 1). The essay fails to explain what the speaker’s point of view is and why it constitutes a bias.  2. “This document is biased because the speaker is a member of the church and wants to show that his side is right” (document 2). The essay fails to explain why the position of church member implies a bias.  3. “This document is biased because the touching of a monarch was believed to cure disease”  (document 9). The essay presents no explanation regarding the motivation of the speaker.   4. “This source may be accurate because the author was a friend of Elizabeth’s tutor” (document 4). The essay fails to explain why a friend of Elizabeth’s tutor would be a reliable source.   5. “The Second Book of Homilies also supports the religious bias against Elizabeth’s ability since it was a piece of literature written by the bishops of the Church of England.” The essay states a fact without analyzing what the bias is or why the bishops held it.    Question 2  Analyze the factors that contributed to the increasing centralization of Spain and the factors that contributed to the continuing fragmentation of Italy in the period 1450–1550.  9–8 points • Thesis is explicit and fully responsive to the question. • Organization is clear, consistently followed, and effective in support of the argument. • Essay is well balanced; covers at some length all major topics suggested by the prompt (at least two factors each for Spain and Italy).  • All major assertions are supported by multiple pieces of relevant evidence and linked to the question. • Essay may contain errors that do not detract from argument.  7–6 points • Thesis is explicit and responsive to the question. • Organization is clear, is effective in support of the argument, but may not be consistently followed. • Essay is balanced; covers at least briefly all major topics suggested by the prompt (two factors each for Spain and Italy). • All major assertions are supported by at least one piece of relevant evidence and linked to the question. • Essay may contain an error that detracts from argument.   5–4 points • Thesis is explicit but not fully responsive to the question. • Organization is clear, is effective in support of the argument, but may not consistently be followed. • Essay shows some imbalance; neglects some major topics suggested by the prompt. • Essay may have two factors for either Spain or Italy and one for the region. • Most of the major assertions are supported by least one piece of relevant evidence and linked to the question. • Essay may contain a few errors that detract from argument.  3–2 points • There is no explicit thesis or the thesis merely repeats or paraphrases the prompt. • Organization is unclear and ineffective. • Essay shows serious imbalance; neglects most major topics suggested by the prompt. • Only one or two major assertions are supported by relevant evidence. • Essay may contain several errors that detract from argument.  1–0 points • There is no discernible attempt at a thesis. • There is no discernible organization. • Essay mentions one or none of the major topics suggested by the prompt. • Little or no supporting evidence is used.  • Essay may contain numerous errors that detract from argument.  Question 2 (continued)  Historical Background  Spain  • Iberia was divided into parts—Portugal, Castile, Aragon, Granada (Muslim ruled until 1492). • Marriage of Ferdinand (d. 1516) and Isabella (d. 1505) took place in 1469. o Opposed by Castilian nobility, Kingdom of Spain was created after 10 years of civil war.  o Assumed thrones in 1474 (Castile) and 1479 (Aragon), but not a monolithic state.  Aragon — federation of territories  Castile • Monarchs asserted authority over nobles. •  of Castile, dominated by urban elements who wanted peace, helped rulers establish superiority. o Centralization:  Reduced number of great nobles in royal council, replaced by lawyers.  Relied heavily on the  (civic militia) to enforce justice.  Encouraged marriage between two nobilities.  Overhauled crown administration, especially financial agencies. • Ability became more important than birth. •  (lesser nobles) depended on royal favor and became more important at court. • Controlled military orders. • Controlled power of great nobles.  Church: • Pope gave Ferdinand and Isabella the title “Catholic Monarchs” and the right to make ecclesiastical appointments in newly won territory after they destroyed the Muslim kingdom in the South.  • Charles I (also Holy Roman Emperor Charles V), successor to Ferdinand and Isabella, gained complete control over Church appointments.  Catholic reformation: Ignatius Loyola created Jesuits in 1534, missionaries and educators who cooperated with Spanish monarchy. Royal administration over towns and  • Royal officials () were given new powers in hierarchy. • Justice system was supervised directly by crown. • Taxes became more efficient.   Spanish monarchy also had effective control over Office of the Inquisition in Spain and used it to foster religious unity.  Reconquista of Muslim Spain was accomplished by 1492 — expelled Jews in 1492, Muslims in 1502, Moriscos in 1506.  Ferdinand created most effective standing army in Europe. • Charles I/V continued Ferdinand and Isabella’s policies. • Spanish colonial empire led to great increase in wealth of Spain in 1500s.    Question 2 (continued)  Historical Background (continued)  Italy  • Unique state structure was developed during the Renaissance. o There were two types of states: republics and principalities. o Five major states (Naples, Papal States, Milan, Florence and Venice) maintained balance of power from 1450 to 1490s with Peace of Lodi (1454). o Venice and Florence were seen as model republics.   Venice was really an oligarchy of aristocratic merchants ruled by an elected doge.  Florence was run by Medici family, originally merchant-bankers. o Principality of Milan:  Ruled by Visconti family, which died out in 1447.  Sforza took over in 1450 and proclaimed it a duchy again until France invaded in 1494.  Eventually fell under Spanish rule. o Papal States:  Pope Alexander VI (1492–1503) was father to Cesare and Lucrezia Borgia.  Popes wanted to restore papal authority undermined by Schism (1378–1417).  Counter-Reformation popes revitalized both spirituality of Church and administration and finances of papacy in Rome but were not generally interested in Italian unification. • Renaissance: o Civic humanism enhanced rivalries between cities. o Humanism and individualism at times emphasized individual achievement over political commitment. o Secularism inhibited the possible unifying force of the Church in Italy. • Italian Wars or Habsburg-Valois Wars (1494–1559):  o Milan asked Charles VIII of France for help in 1494 against Florence and Naples, thereby starting Italian Wars.  Rome was sacked by imperial troops in 1527; symbolized the weakness of Italy in the face of foreign invasion.  Charles V gained control of much of the peninsula in 1529 (Peace of Cambrai) and took Milan in 1535. o Fighting ended in 1559, but Habsburgs controlled Italy except for Venice, Tuscany (under the Medici) and Papal States. o Italian Wars demonstrated that small Italian city-states could not withstand large, centralized monarchies like Spain or France. Italy remained divided and largely under foreign rule by mid-1500s.   Question 3  Compare and contrast Enlightenment and Romantic views of nature, with reference to specific individuals and their works.  9–8 points • Thesis is explicit and responsive to the question, addressing all tasks of the question. • Organization is clear, consistently followed, and effective in support of the argument. • Essay addresses all tasks suggested by the question (comparison of Enlightenment and Romantic views of nature, contrast of Enlightenment and Romantic views of nature). • Major assertions are supported by development of at least one Enlightenment figure and/or works and at least one Romantic figure and/or works. • Essay may contain errors that do not detract from argument.  7–6 points • Thesis is explicit and responsive to the question. • Organization is clear and effective in support of the argument. • Essay addresses all tasks suggested by the question (comparison of Enlightenment and Romantic views of nature, contrast of Enlightenment and Romantic views of nature). • Major assertions are supported by discussion of one Enlightenment figure and/or works and one Romantic figure and/or works. • Essay may contain an error that detracts from argument.  5–4 points • Thesis is explicit but not fully responsive to the question; may contrast views of nature without providing a relevant comparison. • Organization is clear in support of the argument but may wander off task. • Essay fails to address all basic tasks of the question; analysis may be simplistic. • Most of the major assertions are supported by relevant evidence; may provide contrast in views about nature without providing a relevant comparison; may provide general treatment of either the Enlightenment’s or Romanticism’s views on nature; or may conflate views on nature of the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment without discussion of the latter. • Essay may contain a few errors that detract from argument.  3–2 points • Thesis may be explicit but fails to address the tasks of the question. • Organization may be ineffective in addressing the tasks of the question. • Essay neglects most major topics suggested by the prompt. • Few or no assertions are supported by relevant evidence; may offer a superficial or generic discussion of individuals and/or works associated with the Enlightenment and Romanticism. • Essay may contain several errors that detract from argument.  1–0 points • Thesis may be erroneous or absent. • Organization is ineffective in addressing the tasks of the question. • Essay may not demonstrate understanding of either period beyond certain generic terms or phrases. • Little or no supporting evidence is provided. • Essay may contain numerous errors that detract from argument. Question 3 (continued)  Historical Background  Scientific Revolution   • Credited with providing a new understanding of the natural world; textbooks explicitly connect the Scientific Revolution to the Enlightenment. Some texts place material for the two periods within the same chapter. • Textbooks provide detailed description and analysis of the medieval worldview and its eventual modification and rejection, beginning with Copernicus and continuing through Brahe, Kepler, Galileo and Newton. The developments in astronomy were paralleled with acceptance of a new methodology for the investigation of the natural world (scientific method). One textbook explicitly asserts that Bacon’s objective in promoting the new methodology was the conquest of nature for the benefit of humanity. • The thinkers of the eighteenth century (philosophes) are credited with the application of reason to the study of human society. Some authors point out that Enlightenment thinkers accepted the mechanistic model of the universe formulated by natural philosophers like Bacon, Descartes and Newton.  • Textbooks place John Locke in a number of contexts. His Essay on Human Understanding (1690) suggested that people are molded by experience; they are “blank slates” (tabula rasa) whose natures are shaped by the physical environment. • Some textbooks identify Newton and Locke as important influences on Enlightenment thinking. Newton is credited with providing an explanation for the universe without divine intervention; discussion of Locke ranges from political and religious ideas to explanations of human character. • The ideas of Newton and other natural philosophers found a wider audience among the educated elite through the royal societies established with state support, salons, popularization texts and coffeehouses.  The Enlightenment   • Central ideas:  o Natural laws — universal principles governed nature and human society. o Mechanical, mathematical model of the natural world:  Voltaire is given credit by some authors for championing Newton’s ideas on the continent.  Many textbooks mention Emilie de Chatelet as a popularizer of Newton’s works.   The Encyclopedia (1751–1772) — compilation of scientific knowledge; focus was on practical application of human knowledge. o Deism — God was regarded as the creator of the universe who set the cosmos in motion and then did not interfere.  o Range of views regarding human nature:  Rousseau — The Social Contract (1762) — taught that man was born good but corrupted by society. Rural life was superior to urban life. Rousseau claimed that many of his most important ideas came while walking in the country.  Voltaire, Hume, Condorcet, Beccaria and d’Holbach are also mentioned in the context of Enlightenment views on human nature.    Question 3 (continued)  Historical Background (continued)  Romanticism  • Rousseau is sometimes identified as a precursor or an inspiration to Romantic thinkers and artists. • Texts usually define Romanticism as a reaction to the Enlightenment or classicism; no consensus exists on the extent of the reaction. • Central ideas:  o Primacy of feeling over reason. o Fascination with nature — described as “awesome and tempestuous,” a source of spiritual inspiration, mysterious, “unruly,” inspiring feelings of awe and dread. o Pantheism — some Romantics associated nature with the divine. • Artists: o William Wordsworth is the most commonly used example of a poet whose work was inspired by his reverence for the natural world. Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein is described in one textbook as a warning against the consequences of challenging the natural world. The brothers Grimm collected folk tales of the German peasantry. William Blake and John Keats also appear as poets deeply affected by the power or the mystery of nature. o Textbooks provide examples of paintings by Friedrich, Turner and Constable to illustrate Romantic attitudes toward the natural world.   Question 4  Analyze how the political and economic problems of the English and French monarchies led to the English Civil War and the French Revolution.  9–8 points • Thesis statement/paragraph is explicit and accurately addresses all four components (political and economic problems in both England and France). • Organization is clear, consistently followed, and effective in support of the argument.  • Essay is well balanced; it analyzes political and economic components in both England and France. • Essay provides one or more specific pieces of evidence for each of the four components. • Essay may contain minor errors that do not detract from argument.   7–6 points • Thesis is explicit and accurately addresses all four components, although it may address one country or component in greater detail. • Organization is clear and effective in support of the argument, but perhaps not consistently followed. • Essay is balanced; all major topics suggested by the prompt are covered at least briefly, although one country or component may be analyzed at greater length. • Essay provides at least one piece of relevant evidence for each of the four components. (Political and economic problems may be discussed together.) • Essay may contain a major error or several minor errors that detract from argument. (Examples: English peasants revolted because they were hungry; French peasants demanded political representation.)  5–4 points • Thesis is explicit but may not be fully responsive to the question; it may accurately mention only one country or only one component. • Organization is clear and effective in support of the argument but may not be consistently followed. • Essay shows some imbalance; may discuss France in detail but England minimally or vice versa. • Supporting examples are present but may be less detailed. • Essay may contain a few errors that detract from argument.  3–2 points • Thesis may be confused, implicit or vague or merely repeat or paraphrase the prompt. • Organization may be unclear, ineffective or both. • Essay shows serious imbalance; may discuss only one component in any relevant detail. • Only one or two major assertions are supported by relevant evidence. • Essay may contain several errors that detract from argument.  1–0 points • There may be no discernible attempt at a thesis, or essay may merely repeat or paraphrase the prompt. • Essay may have no discernible organization. • One or none of the major topics suggested by the prompt is mentioned. • Little or no supporting evidence is used. • Essay may contain numerous errors that detract from argument.  Question 4 (continued)  Historical Background  England  Political problems  Charles I’s political difficulties stemmed in part from his wish to be absolute monarch and the perception of him as a Roman Catholic sympathizer. Charles’s rocky relationship with Parliament resulted in the Petition of Right (1628), which condemned forced loans, reiterated the right of habeas corpus, declared that soldiers and sailors could not be housed in private homes without the homeowner’s consent, and said that civilians should not be subjected to martial law (all of which Charles had done in 1626 to pay for a war with Spain that Parliament refused to finance). Irritated by Parliament, Charles did not call it into session from 1629 until 1640; this period was called the Personal Rule. When he called the Short Parliament (April–May 1640), he did not want to listen to the grievances that had built up during the Personal Rule. However, he was forced to listen to these grievances when the Long Parliament opened in November. Almost immediately the Long Parliament passed bills that repudiated Charles’s Personal Rule, including the Triennial Act (1641), which declared that Parliament had to be called at least once every three years. The final straw in this tumultuous relationship came in January 1642 when Charles attempted to arrest the five members of Parliament (MPs) who were key figures of the opposition. This action was a violation of parliamentary sovereignty.  Economic problems  The English crown’s reliance on the House of Commons for grants and taxes (the power of the purse) often made relations between the monarchy and Parliament difficult, as Charles I discovered. His first Parliament, in June 1625, granted him tonnage and poundage for only one year, rather than the customary lifetime grant. Charles collected these taxes anyway, without parliamentary approval, in subsequent years. This flouting of the law made MPs angry and contributed to Charles’s reputation as a potential absolutist.  During the period of his Personal Rule (1629–1640), Charles revived old taxes. These included distraint of knighthood (fining eligible people who had not applied for knighthood), enforcing the ancient boundaries of royal forests, collecting ship money (traditionally a levy in the form of money or ships from coastal towns in time of emergency, but expanded by Charles during the Personal Rule), and using the Court of the Star Chamber to raise money by collecting fees and fines. Charles also collected forced loans. In addition, during the Personal Rule Charles’s minister Thomas Wentworth implemented the highly unpopular policy of Thorough, which aimed to strengthen the monarchy, to collect money owed to the crown, and to make government more efficient.   Charles’s need for money to finance an army against the Scots following the First Bishops’ War (1638) forced him to call the Short Parliament (April–May 1640). The Second Bishops’ War (August–October 1640) ended with an agreement that the English would pay the Scots a large sum. To get this money, Charles had to call Parliament again in November (the Long Parliament). It was the members of the Long Parliament who eventually led the rebellion against the king.       Question 4 (continued)  Historical Background (continued)  France  Political problems   Louis XVI was not an impressive monarch. He was not educated to rule, was physically unprepossessing, and was preoccupied with hunting and his privileges. He was also faced with increasing resistance from the local parlements, which in the 1750s and 1760s joined the Paris parlement in its traditional role of defending local privileges against the king. In 1771 Louis XV’s chancellor, René Nicolas de Maupeou,  began to abolish the parlements. This unpopular action was seen as replacing local control with central control. Wanting to be popular, Louis XVI dismissed Maupeou and recalled the parlements at the end of 1774. However, the parlements now saw how fragile their power was, which explains their later resistance to the king.  Under Louis XVI the parlements became increasingly resistant to royal decrees, particularly new taxes. The parlement of Paris refused to register a tax and said that only the Estates General could approve such a tax. Local parlements also refused to register new taxes, forcing the crown to resort to the lit de justice, the ceremony to force the parlement to register the tax. There were riots and calls for the Estates General (First Estate, clergy; Second Estate, nobility; Third Estate, commoners). As they voted by Estate, the First and Second Estates could combine to outvote the Third Estate — the unequal voting structure was a source of political friction.  Abbé Sieyès’s pamphlet, What Is the Third Estate? (January 1789), was one of the most famous pamphlets of this period and foreshadowed the power of the Third Estate.   Economic problems   France was relatively prosperous for the middle half of the eighteenth century, although some textbooks draw a line of continuous debt from Louis XIV or Louis XV to Louis XVI. All textbooks note the inequality of taxation. The clergy paid no taxes but gave a yearly “gift”; nobles paid few taxes (only 10 percent of all taxes collected by the 1780s); tax collectors were corrupt and inefficient (kept 60 percent of all taxes collected by the 1780s). France also had a large debt, which increased after its support of the United States in the American Revolution. In 1788 almost half the national income went to pay the principal and interest on the debt.  France also experienced bad weather, poor harvests and high food prices in the 1780s, all of which contributed to unrest among the peasantry and the urban poor.  Louis XVI had several finance ministers in five years (Anne Robert Turgot, Jacques Necker, Charles Alexandre de Calonne, Étienne Charles Loménie de Brienne and Necker again). All but Necker, who glossed over the financial problems, proposed financial reforms, including abolishing sinecures, internal customs barriers and guilds; instituting new land taxes; abolishing the salt tax (the gabelle), requiring money instead of services from the peasants, replacing the inequitable taille with a land tax that the rich as well as the poor would have to pay, and abolishing the vingtième and replacing it with a direct tax levied on all landowners. However, the parlements and the Assembly of Notables opposed these reforms. Facing revolt by the privileged groups, Louis XVI reluctantly called the Estates General.    Question 4 (continued)  Historical Background (continued)  Key Dates in the Buildup to the English Civil War  1603: James VI of Scotland became James I of England (d. 1625). 1625: Charles I succeeded his father as king of England (r. 1625–1649). 1628: Parliament passed the Petition of Right. 1629–1640: Charles I undertook Personal Rule (did not call Parliament). 1638: First Bishops’ War took place (first war for which the monarch did not have parliamentary approval). 1640: Second Bishops’ War occurred. 1640: Short Parliament took place (April–May). 1640: Long Parliament opened. 1641: Long Parliament passed the Triennial Act, prohibited arbitrary taxation and abolished the prerogative courts (Court of High Commission, Star Chamber). 1642: Charles attempted to arrest five MPs (January). 1642: Fighting broke out between Royalist and Parliamentarian forces (September).  Key Dates in the Buildup to the French Revolution  1771: Parlements was abolished by Louis XV. 1774: Louis XVI succeeded his grandfather, Louis XV (r. 1774–1793); reestablished parlements. 1774–1776: Turgot served as French finance minister; proposed ambitious reforms. 1786: Assembly of Notables convened (for the first time in 160 years) to approve Calonne’s plan to reform   finances, but it refused to do so. 1787: Calonne was dismissed; increasing intransigence of parlements. 1788: French government was bankrupt. 1788: Louis XVI was forced to call the Estates General (which had last been convened by Louis XIII   in 1614). 1788–1789: Massive inflation occurred; food prices rose dramatically. 1789: Meeting of the Estates General opened (May). 1789: Tennis Court Oath (June 20). 1789: Bastille was stormed (July 14). 1789: Privileges were renounced (August 4).    Question 5  Analyze how industrialization and imperialism contributed to the development of consumer culture in the period 1850–1914.  9–8 points  • Thesis explicitly explains how industrialization and imperialism led to the development of consumer culture.

He went into exile following the execution of his brother owing to his involvement in an assassination attempt against Tsar Alexander III. Lenin returned to Russia with the aid of the Germans in the midst of World War I.  Lenin’s writings, perhaps most notably his April Theses, attempted to reconcile Marxist ideology with the circumstances of the Russian state and society. Lenin’s attempts at reconciliation included the following assertions:  • Marx asserted that communist revolution would occur first in the most economically developed nations (e.g., Great Britain, Germany). However, Lenin argued that revolutionary activity would more easily establish a foothold in the “weakest link” of the capitalist system and subsequently spread throughout the capitalist chain. • Lenin argued that a small group of professional revolutionaries could best enact a successful revolution in an autocratic nation such as Russia, rather than relying on a spontaneous workers’ revolution. • Lenin rejected any notion of cooperation with the Russian provisional government or other “compromise” socialist groups. • Lenin added a condemnation of imperialism to the Marxist critique of capitalism.  Lenin utilized slogans such as “Peace, Bread, and Land” and “All power to the soviets!” to promote his Bolshevik agenda over that of the increasingly unpopular provisional government. He was able to capitalize on this lack of support to establish the Bolsheviks firmly in power during the October Revolution. Lenin entered into the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany, despite substantial loss of territory for the Russians, both because he recognized the unpopularity of the war and because he believed that national borders would become inconsequential once the communist revolution spread.  The Bolsheviks validated peasant seizures of land and factories and disbanded a newly elected Constituent Assembly, which was dominated by Menshevik factions. Despite opposition from a coalition of forces known as the White Army, the Bolshevik forces under the leadership of Leon Trotsky were ultimately victorious in the Russian Civil War (1918–1923). The Bolsheviks implemented a policy known as “war communism,” which nationalized key industries and collectivized agriculture. Harsh policies were introduced for peasants who refused to surrender their grain and livestock. Further, the Bolsheviks formed a secret police force (known originally as the Cheka and later as the NKVD and the KGB) to root out opposition. By 1922 Lenin and the Bolsheviks exerted full authority over most of the territory of the former Russian Empire and used the Cheka to implement a Red Terror aimed at eliminating thousands of “class enemies” of the state through widespread execution without trial. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was declared in 1922.  Beyond the borders of the USSR, many communists maintained a belief in the imminent overthrow of capitalism. The Bolsheviks called for the formation of the Third International (or Comintern) in 1919. Though designed to be an international alliance of socialist groups, the Third International was clearly dominated by the ever increasing power of the newly emerging USSR.    Question 6 (continued)  Historical Background (continued)  War communism proved disastrous to the already struggling Russian economy. In the face of economic collapse, Lenin instituted a revised policy, known as the New Economic Policy (NEP), in 1921. The NEP represented a compromise with capitalism by allowing small-scale private ownership of businesses. Peasants also gained greater control over the distribution of their crops. The NEP produced some success, but it failed to boost Russian productivity beyond prewar levels and created a split among the USSR’s leadership about the wisdom of such a compromise policy.  Socially, women made substantial gains in terms of equality under Lenin’s rule. Women gained the right to vote in 1918. They also gained the right to divorce and greater access to birth control and abortion. Fundamental changes to the position of women in Soviet society were somewhat slow in coming, however, despite the formation of a women’s bureau designed to promote education among women. The Soviets also created the Communist Youth League to promote communist ideology and party membership. Artists and intellectuals were also involved in promoting procommunist ideology, though artists were allowed to engage in experimental techniques in genres such as film and visual art.  Joseph Stalin  Lenin suffered a series of strokes that left him increasingly debilitated, setting up a power struggle between Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin. Despite Trotsky’s dynamic leadership as commissar of war in the early part of the Russian Revolution, Joseph Stalin’s successful manipulation of patronage as the Communist Party’s general secretary allowed him to gain party support and cement his power by 1928.  Stalin ended the NEP and began building his “socialism in one country” program, since a communist world revolution seemed increasingly unlikely. To promote his goal of rapid industrialization, Stalin imposed the first of a series of Five Year Plans in 1928 aimed at making the USSR competitive with the rest of the industrialized world. These plans called for a central government agency known as Gosplan to manage resource allocation and production. The Five Year Plans were aimed primarily at increasing capital good production. Despite significant hardships as a result of this emphasis on capital goods, the Five Year Plans produced some degree of success and brought the USSR into a competitive position with other leading nations in heavy industry.  Stalin took aim at the wealth of the kulaks to build Soviet industry and infrastructure. He forcibly collectivized agriculture. Resistance from the kulaks led to reprisals and millions of deaths; some died from open resistance to collectivization policies, while others died from famine resulting from confiscation of food or the intentional destruction of crops and livestock during the resistance movement.   Stalin imposed totalitarian rule on the USSR. Independent political parties were outlawed and freedom of expression was eliminated. The cultural life of the Soviet Union existed primarily as a means of propaganda. Stalin advocated socialist realism, forms of artistic expression that glorified the worker and industry. Further, Stalin promoted his own cult of personality by having life-sized posters of himself displayed throughout the country.   To achieve his goals, Stalin attempted to strengthen the party bureaucracy under his control. Stalin remained fearful of the “Old Bolsheviks” who were part of the original revolution. He conducted a series of Great Purges that eliminated these perceived threats through a series of public confessions and executions.    Question 6 (continued)  Historical Background (continued)  Socially, women saw setbacks in some of the steps toward legal equality that they had achieved under Lenin. Stalin was concerned about declining birthrates. Therefore, in an effort to increase the Soviet birthrate, the Stalinist regime undid many of the gains that women had made in controlling reproduction.    Abortion was outlawed. Stalin praised the family and its role in inculcating traditional values of duty and discipline. Divorce became much more difficult and motherhood was promoted. The Stalinist regime made education more attainable, especially for technical or engineering-related fields.  Events before and during the Second World War led Stalin to a more assertive foreign policy. Despite significant ideological differences, Stalin entered into a nonaggression pact with Hitler’s Nazi Germany just before the outbreak of the war. Stalin used the interval of peace with Germany to expand Soviet territory, taking the Baltic states, Bessarabia, eastern Poland and parts of Finland. Eventually, however, the USSR was forced to join forces with the Allied powers after being invaded by Nazi Germany in 1941. Despite the devastation wrought by World War II on the USSR, Stalin capitalized on his status as leader of a victorious power and was instrumental in exacerbating the tensions leading to the emergence of the Cold War.  Question 7  Analyze the ways in which Western European nations have pursued European economic and political integration from 1945 to the present, referring to at least two nations.  9–8 points • Thesis explicitly addresses both economic and political integration.  • Essay is organized, clearly developing both parts of the question. • At least two countries are referred to specifically and accurately connected to integration issue. • Essay uses multiple pieces of specific evidence to support claims for both economic and political integration. • Essay may contain errors that do not detract from argument.  7–6 points • Thesis refers to both economic and political integration. • Essay is organized; economic and political integration issues are covered with a few examples but may be somewhat uneven. • Two countries are accurately referred to but with uneven connection to integration issues. • Essay uses a few examples of specific evidence to support both economic and political integration but may be uneven. • Essay may contain an error that detracts from argument.  5–4 points • Thesis may only address one aspect of European integration or may only be contextual. • Organization is clear, but there may be significant imbalance in the treatment of economic and political integration. • Essay refers to two European countries relevantly, but one assertion may not be completely accurate.  • Essay supports claims for economic or political integration with specific evidence. • Essay may contain a few errors that detract from argument.  3–2 points • There is no explicit thesis, or one that merely paraphrases the question or is a generic response. • Structure is disorganized, with minimal treatment of either economic or political integration, or completely omits one. • Essay refers to only one specific country accurately. • Essay supports only one or two claims with relevant specific evidence. • Essay may contain several errors that detract from argument.  1–0 points • There is no discernible attempt at a thesis or a completely inadequate attempt. • There is no clear attempt to organize the essay in a manner that addresses the question. • Essay makes little or no attempt to use relevant specific evidence. • Essay may contain numerous errors that detract from argument. Question 7 (continued)  Historical Background  Dates of treaties refer to when the treaty was signed.  Economic Integration  Marshall Plan (1947–1952) was a United States program to help European reconstruction after the Second World War.  • Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) administered the plan and coordinated  the economic policies of member states. • $13.15 billion in U.S. aid was sent to Europe under the plan. • The plan contributed to rapid economic recovery in recipient countries and helped promote the beginnings of economic integration.  Benelux customs union (1948) abolished tariff barriers among the Low Countries.   Franco-German Coal and Steel Pact (1950) was led by economist Jean Monnet and French foreign minister Robert Schuman. Schuman Declaration (1950) called for a supranational organization of European states.  European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), created by Treaty of Paris (1951), eliminated trade barriers among the coal and steel industries of Germany, France, Benelux countries and Italy. The same members created the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) in 1957.  Treaty of Rome (1957) established the European Economic Community (EEC or Common Market, later called the European Community or EC), which initially consisted of France, West Germany, Benelux and Italy.  • Treaty created a free market, eliminated tariffs among member states, and declared the intention to establish a common tariff toward all other nations (accomplished by 1968).  • EEC/EC also coordinated social and economic policies among member states. • Great Britain, Ireland and Denmark joined the EEC in 1973; Greece, in 1981; Spain and Portugal, in 1986. • EEC/EC eventually became largest single trading bloc in the world, accounting for more than  20 percent of world economic output.  Schengen Agreement (1985) allowed for travel without passports among several Western European countries  (later expanded and folded into the structure of the European Union).  Single European Act (1987) was ratified by the parliamentary bodies of all member states and called for the following:  • a common monetary unit, the euro • free movement of goods, labor, capital and services • coordination of social welfare policies and charter of labor rights • common production standards • uniform tax rates • recognition of each other’s professional licensing Question 7 (continued)  Historical Background (continued)   Several European Free Trade Area (EFTA) nations joined the 12 EC nations in 1991 to create the European Economic Area.  Treaty of European Union (Maastricht Treaty, 1992) confirmed the arrangements of the Single European Act and created the European Union (EU), establishing the following:  • a stronger central banking system (European Monetary Institute) • a common defense system • common social policies regarding immigration and labor practices  More countries eventually joined the EU: Austria, Finland and Sweden (1995); Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Cyprus and Malta (2004); Romania and Bulgaria (2007).  In 1999 the euro was established as a virtual currency for settling financial accounts. In 2002 euro notes and coins were issued, replacing several national currencies in Western Europe.   Political Integration  Council of Europe was created in Strasbourg in 1948:  • Could not pass binding legislation but could provide forums for discussion. • Mission was to uphold individual and political freedom and rule by law. • Human Rights Commission began to hear petitions regarding violations.  NATO, a defensive alliance among Western European countries and the United States, was established in 1949 primarily as a counter to the perceived threat of the Soviet bloc.  In 1967 ECSC, EEC and Euratom were combined into the European Community. In the 1970s and 1980s the EC was more of an intergovernmental organization than a supranational entity; this trend was heightened by increased diversity of its member countries.  In 1979 citizens of member nations began voting directly for candidates to the European Parliament, but the Parliament’s influence as a legislature did not grow significantly.  The EU is currently moving from an intergovernmental role toward a supranational one, opening the way for greater political integration. The Treaty on European Union (Maastricht Treaty) required member nations to demonstrate acceptable standards of democratic government and human rights. The treaty also introduced the idea of European citizenship. In addition to aspects of the treaty listed in the section on economic integration above, the treaty also included the following:  • Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) • provisions for police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters • expansion of the role of the European Parliament    Question 7 (continued)  Historical Background (continued)  In 2005 the European Parliament ratified a new constitution to streamline decision making and better coordinate economic, employment, diplomatic and defense policies, but several member countries held referenda that rejected the proposed constitution.  In 2007 France and Germany produced a simplified version for ratification.  Summary of EU governing structure:  • Council of the European Union is the main decision-making body. It represents the member states. • European Parliament represents the people and shares legislative and budgetary power with the council. • European Commission represents the common interests of the EU and is the prime executive body ensuring implementation of policy.
