Question 1 — Document-Based Question (DBQ)  Analyze the factors that contributed to the emergence of a workers’ opposition movement in communist Poland in the period 1956–1981.   Historical Background: After the Second World War, Poland became part of the Soviet bloc and the Polish communist party had a virtual monopoly on power.   BASIC CORE: 1 point each to a total of 6 points   1. Provides an appropriate, explicitly stated thesis that directly addresses all parts of the question. Thesis must not simply restate the question.  The thesis must refer to at least TWO specific causal factors. The thesis must suggest a minimal level of analysis drawn from the documents. The thesis may appear in either the introduction OR the conclusion.  2. Discusses a majority of the documents individually and specifically.  The essay must discuss at least seven documents — even if used incorrectly — by reference to anything in the box. Documents can be cited by number or by name, or they can be referenced in other ways that make it clear which document is being discussed. Documents cannot be referenced together in order to get credit for this point (e.g., “Documents 1, 4, and 6 suggest …”) unless they are discussed individually.  3. Demonstrates understanding of the basic meaning of a majority of the documents (may misinterpret no more than one).  An essay may not significantly misinterpret more than one document. A major misinterpretation is an incorrect analysis or one that leads to an inaccurate grouping or a false conclusion.  An essay cannot earn this point if no credit was awarded for point 2 (discusses a majority of the documents).   A document that is erroneously grouped with other documents is considered a misinterpretation.  4. Supports the thesis with appropriate interpretations of a majority of the documents.  The essay must use at least seven documents correctly, and the documents used in the body of the essay must provide support for the thesis.  An essay cannot earn this point if no credit was awarded for point 1 (appropriate thesis). An essay also cannot earn this point if no credit was awarded for point 2 (discusses a majority of the documents).  5. Analyzes point of view or bias in at least three documents.  The student must make a reasonable effort to explain why a particular source expresses the stated view by:  • relating authorial point of view to author’s place in society (motive, position, status, etc.); OR  • evaluating the reliability of the source; OR  • recognizing that different kinds of documents serve different purposes; OR  • analyzing the tone of the documents; analysis must be clear and relevant.  Note: 1. Attribution alone is not sufficient to earn credit for point of view (POV). 2. It is possible for essays to discuss point of view collectively (e.g., can include two or three documents to make a single POV analysis), but this counts for only one point of view. Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  6. Analyzes documents by explicitly organizing them in at least three appropriate groupings.  A grouping must contain at least two documents that are used correctly and individually.  Groupings and corresponding documents may include the following:   The following groupings are not exhaustive:   Political repression by Communist Party  Critique of dissent: 1, 3, 7, 12  Complaints about lack of rights (e.g., freedom of speech): 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9  Increasing discontent among workers: 6, 8, 9, 11, 12  Catholic criticism of repression: 5, 11 Political action by dissidents  Support of activists: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9  Opposition activists in Poland: 2, 6, 8, 9, 11  Support of workers’ movement outside Poland: 4, 6  Expression of discontent from workers’ and strikers’ point of view  Defending workers’ protest: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11  Support for workers by nonworkers: 2, 4, 5, 6  Desire for independent labor unions: 4, 9 Economic discontent  Failure of Communist party to provide economic well-being for workers: 2, 6, 9, 10  Workers’ economic challenges: 6, 8, 9, 10 Religious actions and critiques  Catholic support for workers’ movement: 5, 11, 7 (due to its reference to Pope John Paul II) Intellectual dissent:   Disjunction between theory and practice of communism: 2, 4, 8, 9  Writers’ critique of exploitation: 2, 4  EXPANDED CORE: 0–3 points to a total of 9 points   Expands beyond the basic core of 1–6. The basic score of 6 must be achieved before an essay can earn expanded core points. Credit awarded in the expanded core should be based on holistic assessment of the essay. Factors to consider in holistic assessment may include:   • Has a clear, analytical, and comprehensive thesis (that explicitly discusses three or more factors for the emergence of a workers’ movement) • Uses all or almost all of the documents (10-12 documents)  • Uses the documents persuasively as evidence • Shows understanding of nuances of the documents  • Analyzes point of view or bias in at least four documents cited in the essay  • Analyzes the documents in additional ways (e.g., develops more groupings)  • Recognizes and develops change over time  • Brings in relevant “outside” information      Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  A Closer Look at the Thesis Statement   Examples of acceptable and unacceptable theses:  Stronger theses:  • “The Communist party’s oppressive regime which grants no political voice nor freedom of speech to the workers significantly made the workers disenchanted with the regime, the pope [sic] support of the Polish People’s Liberalist movement to break out from the Communist party’s oppression also helped the workers’ movement gain force in a largely Catholic country like Poland. Finally, the dissatisfaction of the workers for their life, both in the factories where they may be subject to random dismissal, or in home where the lack of consumer goods made life all the more unsatisfactory, provided the Solidarity with a wide base of support with workers eager to advance their life quality.”  • “Many factors led to the worker opposition to the communist government. Workers protested because the government falsely represented their political motives and ignored their demands for more democratic rights. Other factors that contributed to the opposition included anger over poor economic conditions, the desire for independent unions, Polish Catholic religious traditions, and intellectuals who criticized the lack of freedom in the communist party.”  Adequate theses:   • “This emergence of a workers’ opposition movement was contributed to by the misrepresentation of the working class by the communist party, unfair treatment of the working class, and controlling ways of the communist party.”  • “The documents discuss three important factors during this time which was unemployment, distrust for communism, and a need for a new system.”  • “During this time the workers were seeking more rights, and protested in public assembly, despite danger of government oppression.”  Inadequate theses:   • “The worker’s opposition movement in Poland was sparked by workers who had been wronged by bosses and the government. While people tried to stop the opposition from happening like the authors in documents 3, 5 and 9, there were others who wanted the opposition to occur, like the authors in documents 1, 2, 4, 8, 10 and 12.”   • “The three different groups in the Polish community who were the Polish Communist Party, the Catholic Church, and the Polish intellectuals tried their best to bring the workers who were fired back to work because they had seen how their economy was declining.”  A Note on Factors: A listing of social groups alone does not constitute factors. A factor suggests some kind of action or causality.   Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  A Closer Look at Misinterpretations   Examples of major misinterpretations or incorrect usage coming from the documents: • Doc 6: “Document six shows how the average wages for Polish workers dropped dramatically in several regions throughout Poland. This demonstrates that the Communist party did not ensure living wages for the people.”  • Doc 6: “Government-sponsored aid from the Communist Party was insufficient in providing a living wage for fired workers.”  • Doc 12: “As a member of Solidarity, Jaruzelski describes how the Solidarity movement continued to grow due to worker dissatisfaction.”  Example of minor errors: • “The bishops’ resolution could be influenced by the fact that in 1976 the ruling pope was Pope John Paul II, who was originally from Poland and lobbied for the wants of the Polish working class, so if the bishops made a good impression on Pope John Paul II, then they may be promoted to a higher position, such as a cardinal or archbishop”.  Pope John Paul II became pope in 1978, two years after Document 5 was published.   • “A chart depicting a trade union’s financial aid for fired workers shows that these workers are being paid less than half the yearly salary of what few who are still working have.”  The document is not from a trade union, and the payments are charitable contributions rather than salaries.  A Closer Look at Point of View  There are many means by which a student can demonstrate point-of-view analysis..  (The following examples are not meant to be exhaustive.)  Examples of ACCEPTABLE point-of-view analysis:  Relating authorial point of view to author’s place in society  • “It is not surprising that a group of Catholic bishops in Poland would demand better treatment of the Polish people because as Church leaders they would naturally be in favor of social justice.”  • “The Polish Communist party is atheistic and would therefore oppose attempts by Christian Churches to advocate on behalf of workers.”  Evaluating the reliability of the source  •  “Kuron and Modzelewski are most likely trustworthy sources because they are members of the Communist party yet they take a critical view of the party. They have seen the issues that they criticize first-hand. (Doc. 2)”  • “This document may not be reliable because Jaruzelski wrote his views in his memoir that he planned to publish and he might have wanted to make Solidarity look like more of a threat to his Communist government than it really was.”  Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Recognizing that different kinds of documents serve different purposes • “Document 7 is obviously an overt attempt at Communist Party propaganda to convince Polish children that the pope is an enemy of the people. The government does not want the pope to successfully spread liberal ideas to the Polish people.”   • “The photograph in Doc. 10 was taken by a Communist party photographer so it is probably an attempt to document for the government economic problems that the Polish people are facing.”  Analyzing the tone of the documents  • “It is ironic that the editorial in the People’s Tribune proclaims that the Communist party and its workers are unified when a large-scale strike a few months earlier resulted in several dozen workers killed at the hands of the government. (Doc. 1)”   Examples of UNACCEPTABLE point-of-view analysis:   • “Edward Gierek is biased because he is a Communist Party leader.”   Why is this unacceptable? This is merely attribution with no attempt at further analysis beyond the stated information from the document itself; the statement does not explain why a Communist Party official might be biased against increased democracy for workers.  (Authorial POV and reliability)  • “General Wojciech Jaruzelski might be stretching the truth in Document 12 because he wrote this statement in a memoir.”  Why is this unacceptable? The statement does not explicitly analyze how an account written in a memoir might influence the veracity of the author’s account.  (Documents serving different purposes)  • “The Document 11 is not biased because it is a photograph and photographs don’t lie.”  Why is this unacceptable? This is merely attribution with a feeble attempt analysis.  The analysis is erroneous in implying that the use of photographs is purely objective. (Documents serving different purposes)  Question 2  Analyze the differences in the approaches to church-state relations advocated by various Protestant groups in the 1500s.   9–8 Points • Thesis is explicit and fully responsive to the question, introducing at least three distinct Protestant approaches to church-state relations.  • Organization is clear, consistently followed, and effective in support of the argument. • Essay is well balanced; major tasks stated in the prompt are all covered at some length; balance between examples or coverage of the entire century is not required. • All major assertions in the essay are supported by multiple pieces of relevant evidence. • May contain errors that do not detract from the argument. • Approaches to church-state relations may be identified as ideas or actions taken by Protestant groups or leaders. • Analysis accounts for differences in approaches by effectively linking them to their causes or purposes.   7–6 Points • Thesis is explicit and responsive to the question introducing at least two distinct Protestant approaches to church-state relations.  • Organization is clear, effective in support of the argument, but may not be consistently supportive of the thesis. • Essay is balanced; all major tasks stated in the prompt are covered at least briefly; balance between examples or coverage of the entire century is not required. • All major assertions in the essay are supported by at least one piece of relevant evidence. • May contain an error that detracts from the argument. • Approaches to church-state relations by different Protestant groups may be unevenly developed; approaches may be identified as ideas or actions taken by Protestant groups or leaders. • Analysis accounts for differences in approaches by linking them to their causes and purposes.    5–4 Points • Thesis is explicit, but not fully responsive to the question; attempts to introduce differences in Protestant approaches to church-state relations may be too generalized.  • Organization is clear but may not be consistently effective in support of the argument. • Essay shows some imbalance; major tasks stated in the prompt are neglected or attempts to address differences in approaches are insufficiently identified or developed.  • Most of the major assertions in the essay are supported by least one piece of relevant evidence. • May contain a few errors that detract from the argument. • The essay may be mostly narrative or present very limited analysis of approaches.  3–2 Points • No explicit thesis, a thesis that merely repeats or paraphrases the prompt, or a thesis that does not address Protestant approaches to church-state relations.  • Organization is unclear and ineffective. • Essay shows serious imbalance; most tasks stated in the prompt are neglected or insufficiently identified or developed. • Major assertions are not adequately supported by relevant evidence or analysis. • May contain several errors that detract from the argument. Question 2 (continued)  1–0 Points • No discernible attempt at a thesis. • No discernible organization. • One or none of the major tasks stated in the prompt is mentioned. • Little or no supporting evidence used.  • May contain numerous errors that detract from the argument.   Question 2 (continued)  Historical Background  • Sixteenth-century religious movements brought tumult to the status quo across the Europe. Changes in religious thought challenged the spiritual and temporal authority of the Catholic Church and introduced new perceptions about the rights and responsibilities of the individual and the community; communal and individual relationships with God; and the power, nature, and purpose of virtually all sources of authority. Responses to these upheavals from both faith communities and governments gained urgency as the reformers' messages about salvation gained adherents and fused with long-standing political and social dissatisfactions, profoundly threatening traditional power arrangements.  • Protestant approaches to church-state relations evolved over the course of the 16th century, varying according to local and national political and social conditions, denominational beliefs and practices, and the influence of new sources of authority. Lutherans, dependent on protection by the nobility of the Holy Roman Empire, took an approach that supported obedience to the state as a primary obligation of good Christians. Calvinists (including the Huguenots, Presbyterians, and others) rejected traditional state primacy and attempted to establish theocratic societies ruled by the elect, first in Geneva, then spreading to Scotland, Scandinavia, England and elsewhere. Zwingli, an early supporter who left Luther’s movement over religious differences and established Protestantism in Zurich, eventually took the approach that governments were God’s agents on earth and should generally be obeyed, a decision that deeply divided his followers. Henry VIII of England melded elements of Catholic practice and theology with the growing popularity of Protestantism in England. His purposes, both political and practical, led to the establishment of a statist Protestant religion which replaced the authority of the Pope with that of the English monarch as head of the Anglican Church. Anabaptism, sometimes referred to as the Radical Reformation, originally separated from other Protestant denominations by rejecting the practice of infant baptism. Their approach to the state was seen as virtually anarchist because they disavowed practices that supported temporal authority, including oath-taking and military service. Nevertheless, Anabaptists also maintained strict theocratic control over virtually all facets of life in their stronghold of Munster. Later groups that grew out of Anabaptism took the path of parallel existence rather than continued resistance to the state.  • Protestant challenges to state authority brought political repression and war, notably with the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598), a bloody and prolonged civil war that demonstrated the complex nature of such conflicts, combining dynastic, class, economic, and political factors with the passion and determination of aroused religious fervor. The eventual settlement near the end of the century, following nearly four decades of war, included limited tolerance for the Protestant minority, the right of Protestant towns to fortify and protect themselves against their monarch (Edict of Nantes), and the religious conversion of the very monarch who had previously led the Huguenot forces. The ironic twist is memorably captured in words attributed to the triumphant rebel-turned-legitimate-monarch, Henry IV: “Paris is well worth a mass.”   Question 2 (continued)  TIMELINE  1517 Martin Luther – 95 Theses. 1521 Diet of Worms. 1523 Zwingli preaches church reform in Zurich with secular town council as basis of authority. 1525 Anabaptists break from Zwingli, separating from all secular control, including oaths and military service. Division caused by the issue of using force to establish New Jerusalem. 1530s Henry VIII ends papal authority in England. 1531–47 Schmalkaldic League/War – Holy Roman Empire princes allied to defend Lutheranism and their political independence; Charles V won war. 1534 Act of Supremacy establishes monarch as head of the Anglican Church. 1536 Calvin’s Institutes of the Christian Religion published; establishes Geneva theocracy.  1547 Death of Henry VIII of England. 1555 Peace of Augsburg – recognizes Lutheran and Catholic states in Germany.  1558–1603 Elizabeth I’s reign. 1560 Calvinism challenges status quo in France. 1562-98 Wars of Religion in France; large Huguenot migration to Netherlands.  1566  Revolt of the Netherlands.   1572 St. Bartholomew’s Day massacre in France. 1587 War of the Three Henrys, last of eight religious civil wars in France. 1589 Henry IV of France converts to Catholicism, begins reign. 1598 Edict of Nantes, end of French Wars of Religion. Question 3  Analyze the similarities in the methods that various absolute monarchs used in the 1600s and 1700s to consolidate and increase their power.   9–8 Points • Thesis is explicit and fully responsive to the question. • Organization is clear, consistent, and effective in support of the argument; discussion of similarities is explicit throughout. • Essay is well balanced, discussing more than one monarch and more than one method. • All major assertions in the essay are supported by multiple pieces of relevant evidence and are well developed; essay addresses similarities of monarchs from both centuries. • May contain errors that do not detract from the argument. (An essay scored 9 does not need to be perfect.)  7–6 Points • Thesis is explicit and responsive to the question. • Organization is clear, effective in support of the argument; discussion of similarities is explicit but may be less developed than a higher scoring essay.  • Essay is balanced, discussing more than one monarch and more than one method. • All major assertions in the essay are supported by at least one piece of relevant evidence, although some arguments may be less developed than a higher scoring essay; essay may address similarities of monarchs from both centuries. • May contain an error that detracts from the argument.  5–4 Points • Thesis is explicit, but not fully responsive to the question or thesis is only partially proven. • Organization is clear, effective in support of the argument, but not consistently followed; discussion of similarities is implicit or not sufficiently developed. • Essay shows some imbalance; discussion contains more than one monarch and at least one method. • Most of the major assertions in the essay are supported by at least one piece of relevant evidence. • Essay is more descriptive than analytical and may be limited to one century. • May contain a few errors that detract from the argument.  3–2 Points • No explicit thesis, a thesis that merely repeats or paraphrases the prompt, or thesis is not proven. • Organization is unclear and ineffective; may contain no discussion of similarities. • Essay shows serious imbalance, only one specific method and monarch are discussed.  • Only one or two major assertions are supported by relevant evidence. • May contain several errors that detract from the argument.  1–0 Points • May have a barely discernible attempt at a thesis, or thesis is not supported. • May have some discernible organization or is irrelevant. • May have little or no supporting evidence, or evidence is irrelevant. • May contain numerous errors that detract from the argument.   Question 3 (continued)  Historical Background  Thesis:   Acceptable theses may include statements about monarchs:  • asserting their control over established elites, such as the landed nobility; • curbing the power of traditional consultative bodies such as parliaments;  • increasing and maintaining standing armies;  • expansionist wars; • expanding service bureaucracies; • employing mercantilist policies; • asserting control over church affairs and religious appointments; • early colonization; • taking measures to grow government revenues; • supporting the arts,  scientific academies, or both, to increase royal prestige; • benefiting from the work of political theorists propounding the theory of the divine rights of kings.  Organization:   It is expected that the most effective essays will be organized according to the types of methods monarchs used, with examples drawn from various case studies as needed, but essays can also be organized as point-by-point comparisons or narratives of two monarchs’ actions. Essays employing the latter organization (comparison of just two monarchs) may earn all nine points, provided the discussion of the categories is analytical and well developed.  Balance:  Perfect balance between periods is not required, but high-quality essays must make some attempt to address both the 17th and the 18th centuries.  Evidence:  a) Monarchs addressed might include:  Louis XIV  Charles I  James I  James II  Frederick II  Frederick William, the “Great Elector”  Maria Theresa  Joseph II  Peter the Great  Catherine the Great   Question 3 (continued)  b) Methods that monarchs used to consolidate their power may include:  Standing armies  Taming the nobles  Bureaucracy, civil service, service nobility  Symbolic politics – visual displays of power  Mercantilist politics, taxes  Control of the church, attempts to control the church  Intellectual theories in support of the monarchy, divine rights, enlightened absolutism  Terminology:   For the purposes of this question, essays may discuss as “absolute monarchs” rulers that are referred to under the rubric of “Enlightened monarchs” in European history textbooks. Question 4  Analyze the differences in the ideas held by various Enlightenment figures concerning the roles of women in European society.   9–8 Points • Thesis is explicit, fully responsive to the question, and clearly addresses at least two distinct ideas. • Organization is clear, consistently followed, and effective in support of the argument. • Essay is well balanced; all major topics suggested by the prompt are all covered at some length. • All major assertions about differences in the essay are supported by multiple pieces of relevant evidence that relate specifically to women’s roles. • May contain errors that do not detract from the argument.  7–6 Points • Thesis is explicit and responsive to the question and clearly addresses at least two distinct ideas. • Organization is clear, effective in support of the argument, but may not be consistently followed. • Essay is balanced; all major topics suggested by the prompt are covered at least briefly. • All major assertions about differences in the essay are supported by at least two pieces of relevant evidence that relate specifically to women’s roles. • May contain an error that detracts from the argument.   5–4 Points • Thesis is explicit and sufficiently addresses distinct ideas on women’s roles but may use nonspecific language in responding to the question. • Organization is clear and effective in support of the argument, but it is not consistently followed. • Essay shows some imbalance; one idea may be more fully developed than the other. • Most of the major assertions about differences in the essay are supported by at least one piece of relevant evidence that relate generally to women’s roles. • May contain a few errors that detract from the argument.  3–2 Points • No explicit thesis or a thesis that merely repeats or paraphrases the prompt, may address only one idea. • Organization is unclear and ineffective. • Essay shows serious imbalance; most major topics suggested by the prompt are neglected. • Only one or two major assertions about differences are supported by at least one piece of relevant evidence that may relate to women’s roles. • May contain several errors that detract from the argument.  1–0 Points • No discernible attempt at a thesis, addresses only one idea, or none. • No discernible organization. • Only one or none of the major topics suggested by the prompt are mentioned. • Little or no supporting evidence is used to demonstrate different ideas of women’s roles or to name one Enlightenment figure with no specific details or ideas relating to women’s roles. • May contain numerous errors that detract from the argument.   Question 4 (continued)  Historical Background  The question asks for an essay about the differences of more than one idea held by Enlightenment figures about the roles of women in European society. The task requires knowledge of figures from the European Enlightenment and the ability to articulate those figures’ different ideas of women’s roles. An essay may assert that the legacy of the Enlightenment is ambivalent in that:  a) many (or most) Enlightenment figures argued that the principles of liberty, equality, and emphasis on reason should be extended to women, and that women ought to have greater access to education, intellectual life, and perhaps even a degree of political equality with men  b) on the other hand, other Enlightenment figures offered new arguments for the exclusion of women from the public sphere, based on emerging bourgeois ideas of domesticity or “natural” differences between the sexes.  Generally accepted dates for the period of the Age of the Enlightenment, an international and cosmopolitan intellectual and cultural movement with regional and national particularities, range from the late 17th (1690) through the 18th century (1789), although some textbooks (e.g., Hunt’s Making of the West) examine the period from 1750–1789. With a singularly secular focus, a large number of figures wrote on reforming governments, and especially the individual’s liberties under those governments, in publications addressed to “the publick.” Gender is but one of the many topics considered by Enlightenment figures; specifically, writings on traditional gender roles considered not only political and civil rights, but also education, vocation, literature, the arts, mathematics, physics, and so on. Gender is, however, a topic unevenly attended by Enlightenment figures — not all considered gender specifically in their writings, but may have offered passing commentary about the nature of women. Women also authored some of the Enlightenment canon in a variety of fields.  Those who wrote specifically on the nature of women or on women’s roles tended to reinforce traditional ideas based on “natural” (biological) differences or criticized as inferior those writers who advocated the inclusion of women in intellectual and other academic affairs. Such figures maintained various views, which ranged from allowing and encouraging women and young girls to pursue an education, to promoting equality of the sexes in economic and political life, to pointing out the contradictions of writers who advocated for being freed from arbitrary or absolute governments while maintaining a similar kind of control over women.  Relevant Historical Figures  The following alphabetical list of some prominent Enlightenment figures offers a quick reference of points of view concerning the roles of women in European society. An asterisk (*) denotes an Enlightenment figure who did not explicitly write or speak on the roles of women, but whose views can be broadly interpreted to fall into a certain category. Placement into a category is based on a preponderance of writings from a figure; an essay could successfully argue for a figure’s placement in a different category by using specific evidence.    Question 4 (continued)  Inclusive view/Progressive ideas  Mixed view/Limited support  Exclusive view/Separate spheres   d'Alembert, Jean-Baptiste le Rond Astell, Mary Catherine the Great* Cavendish, Lady Margaret Châtelet, Emilie Christina, Queen of Sweden Coffeehouses/Debate Societies ▪ Adkins, Elizabeth/Moll King ▪ Carlisle House ▪ Female Congress  ▪ Female Parliament ▪ La Belle Assemblee  Condorcet, Nicolas Czartoryska, Zofia De Gouges, Olympe Franklin, Benjamin Herder, Johann Gottfried* Kauffman, Angelica Macaulay, Catharine Maria Theresa* Montagu, Lady Mary Wortley Montesquieu, Baron de Salon/Salonnières  ▪ Beaumer, Mme. ▪ Gacon-Dufour, Mme. ▪ Geoffrin, Marie-Therese ▪ Herz, Henriette ▪ Lespinasse, Jeanne-Julie ▪ Le Journal des Dames ▪ Maine, Duchesse ▪ Maintenon, Mme. ▪ Necker, Suzanne ▪ Poisson, Jeanne-Antionette ▪ Pompadour, Mme. ▪ Puisseux, Mme. ▪ Rambouillet, Catherine ▪ Récamier, Jeanne-Françoise ▪ Sevigne, Mme. de Staël, Germaine Smith, Adam* Smith, Charlotte Turner Wollstonecraft, Mary   Beccaria, Cesare Diderot, Denis Encyclopédie Hobbes, Thomas Hume, David* Locke, John Voltaire   d’Holbach (Paul-Henri Thiery) Jefferson, Thomas Kant, Immanuel Napoleon, Bonaparte Rousseau, Jean-Jacques   Question 5  Analyze major factors that caused people to move from the countryside to cities in Europe during the 1800s.   9–8 Points • Thesis is explicit and explains multiple factors, both those that push people from the countryside and those that attract people to the cities in Europe. • Organization is clear, consistently followed, and effective in support of the argument, employing strong and explicit linkage between factors and migration. • Essay is well balanced; all major topics suggested by the prompt are covered at some length.  May address the differences between earlier and later 1800s, or between eastern and western Europe.  (Most essays concentrate on Great Britain.) • All major assertions in the essay are supported by multiple pieces of relevant evidence. Will address both agrarian factors and industrial factors leading to migration and urbanization. • May contain errors that do not detract from the argument or some information that is off task.  7–6 Points • Thesis is explicit and explains multiple factors that caused people to move from the countryside to cities in Europe. • Organization is clear, effective in support of the argument, but not consistently followed, employs explicit linkage between factors and migration. • Essay is balanced; all major topics suggested by the prompt are covered at least briefly.  Addresses both agrarian factors and industrial factors leading to migration and urbanization, but one may be addressed more thoroughly. • All major assertions in the essay are supported by at least one piece of relevant evidence. • May contain an error that detracts from the argument or information that is off task.   5–4 Points • Thesis is explicit, but not always fully responsive to the question.

Linkage may not be well developed. • Essay shows some imbalance; some major topics suggested by the prompt are neglected.  May lean more heavily toward why people left the countryside or why they were drawn to the cities. • Most of the major assertions in the essay are supported by at least one piece of relevant evidence. • May contain a few errors that detract from the argument and information that is off task.  3–2 Points • No explicit thesis or a thesis that merely repeats or paraphrases the prompt.  • Organization is unclear and ineffective, may be repetitious.  Linkage may be suggested or implied. Generalizations (“the Industrial Revolution”) may be given as factors, but not linked to migration. • Essay shows serious imbalance; most major topics suggested by the prompt are neglected.  May mention factors and not support them with evidence or develop them in the essay.  • Only one major assertion is supported by evidence, which may be off task. • May contain several errors that detract from the argument OR information that is off task, or both.   Question 5 (continued)  1–0 Points • No discernible attempt at a thesis. • No discernible organization, with little or no linkage to migration from countryside to city. • One or none of the major topics suggested by the prompt is mentioned. • Little or no supporting evidence used.  • May contain numerous errors that detract from the argument, OR may be entirely off task, or both.   Question 5 (continued)  Historical Background  The factors discussed in the essays may include:  Agricultural Revolution and agricultural changes  • Crop rotation and nitrogen-rich crops – clover, peas, beans, grasses, turnips (potatoes widely consumed by 1700s) allowed for more livestock grazing, meaning more meat and more manure as fertilizer. • Scientific farming and new technology – Jethro Tull’s seed drill, 1701; Charles “Turnip” Townsend (1730s) field rotation and turnips; selective breeding by Robert Bakewell (1780s) and Thomas Coke (1790s) finer wool in sheep, bigger oxen; stronger horses; cast-iron plow in use by 1730. • Enclosure movement and Enclosure Acts (mostly 1750 – 1860) – End of open field system; benefitted large landowners; land reclamation came from drainage of wetlands, accumulation of commons. • Small farmers forced to be wage laborers (described in some texts as proletarianization) or tenant farmers. Increase of landless peasants in France, Spain, Germany, Sweden, Ireland. • Farms become more productive. British agricultural output increased 43 percent in 1700s ; required fewer workers and couldn’t support the number of rural laborers. • Population expands: Better nutrition, decline in death rates, also some increase in birth rates; fewer plagues, but also more food; English population increased 50 percent between 1750 and 1800. • Unique to England (and Low Countries), situation in most of Europe different. New agriculture techniques spread slowly to the rest of Western Europe, but most still lived on subsistence plots and had little surplus production. Eastern Europe – many peasants forced back into serfdom, especially Prussia, Poland, Ukraine; however, serfdom abolished in Austrian Empire in 1848, and Russia in 1861. First Industrial Revolution  • Rural poor move to cities for industrial jobs; end of cottage industry, putting-out system. • Textile inventions: Kay’s flying shuttle (1733); Hargreaves’ spinning jenny (1760); Arkwright’s water frame (1769) – by 1790s cotton yarn production grew 10 times, and by 19th century all cotton spinning was concentrated in large-scale factories and first steam engine introduced in Nottingham in 1790; Crompton’s spinning mule and Whitney’s cotton gin (1790) and Cartwright’s power loom (1800). By 1820, cotton cloth made up almost half of British exports; by 1830, mechanized cotton accounted for 22 percent  of country’s entire industrial production. • Steam inventions – Newcomen engine (1702); James Watt’s and Matthew Boulton’s steam engines (1760s); by 1780s it was a practical and commercial success in Britain; Henry Cort’s puddling furnace (1780s) leads to rolling mills for iron production. • Early factories – single workspace replaced widespread home-based manufacture; employed entire families initially; relied on unskilled or semi-skilled labor; discipline, regulated time maximized production; work repetitive and boring, sometimes dangerous; pay was regular.   Question 5 (continued)  Second Industrial Revolution  • New inventions in medicine, electrical machinery, chemicals, weapons, large-scale commercial food canning created jobs in cities; department and catalogue stores needed workers; white-collar and clerical jobs expanded the urban population (clerks for banks, railroads, insurance companies, etc.). • Later factories quickly grew as cottage industries declined; artisans and cottage industries replaced by machines; machine tools introduced in greater numbers beginning in 1840s; Henry Cort – puddling furnace 1780s and steam powered rolling mills. In 1740s iron production was 17,000 tons; in 1806, 260,000 tons; in 1844, 3 million tons. Once expensive, iron became cheap, indispensible building block of economy. Bessemer process (1850s) led to large-scale production of steel. • Jobs for men, women, and children, but after 1830s divided by sex and no longer sharing the same working hours; stable wages.  Advances in transportation   Railroads – provided jobs for rural populations who built them; workers needed for operations, maintenance, management as well; Ease of transportation – George Stephenson and The Rocket (1829), Liverpool and Manchester Railway; reduced costs and uncertainty of shipping freight promoted growth of large factories as well as cities; encouraged by governments – 1835 British Parliament passed acts to establish 750 miles of track. By 1852, there were more than 7,500 miles of track. Belgium sponsored unified railway network in 1830s; Prussia guaranteed interest and principal on RR bonds.  Urbanization   Growth of cities 1750-1900 – Began in England in 1770s and 1780s in textile manufacturing and spread rapidly on the Continent in the 1830s and 1840s. Less than 8 percent  of English population in agriculture by 1900; over 50 percent of English population lived in cities by 1850 (Manchester 25,000 in 1772; 455,000 in 1851).  Death rates were higher than birth rates in most large cities in first half of 19th century, so population grew because of influx of people from the countryside.  Major cities and commercial hubs no longer needed to be near water because of steam engine.  Poor living conditions – tenements, unsanitary, open drains; Dickens’ novels (e.g., Hard Times) mention coal dust, factory smoke, workhouse conditions (Oliver Twist).   Question 5 (continued)  Reforms, Policy Concerns, Economic Theories   The Poor Laws (1834) created workhouses, reduced costs to communities; the Sadler Commission (1832) documented working conditions for women and children in textile mills; The Factory Act of 1833 and the Mines Act of 1842 regulated hours and conditions for women and children; Edwin Chadwick’s “Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Laboring Population of Britain” (1842) led to campaigns and legislation against cholera, prostitution, crime e.g., the Public Health Act (1848); the Vaccination Act (1853); the Contagious Diseases Act (1864).   Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations contributed to laissez faire economics; Thomas Malthus’s work argued that overpopulation would lead to poverty; David Ricardo’s “Iron law of wages” postulated that wages would always sink to the subsistence level.  Urban Reform and Improvements   Urban reform programs in Vienna, Rome, Paris, London, and Berlin drew people with parks, widened streets, museums, city halls, opera houses, public gardens, and leisure time organized activities; Georges Hausmann’s rebuilding of Paris created boulevards, green spaces, wiping out slums; civic pride drew people who liked the excitement of the city – Crystal Palace in London (1851); electric streetcars in 1890s.  Government projects to modernize sewer and sanitary systems; sewers in London, Paris, Vienna; London and Riga (then in Russia) piped in fresh drinking water. Question 6  Analyze how warfare and the rise of totalitarian regimes affected the development of the arts in Europe during the first half of the 1900s.   9–8 Points • Thesis is explicit and deals with effects of warfare and totalitarian regimes on art. • Organization is clear and develops both aspects of the thesis. • Essay is well balanced; it deals with effects of warfare and totalitarian regimes. • All major assertions are supported by specific artists, movements, works of art, literature, film, OR music. • May contain errors that do not detract from the argument.  7–6 Points • Thesis is explicit and suggests the impact of warfare and totalitarian regimes on art. • Organization is clear, but argument on impact may not be fully developed. • Essay is balanced; deals with impact of warfare and totalitarianism on art, at least briefly. • All major assertions are supported by some specific evidence of impact on art. • May contain an error that detracts from the argument   5–4 Points • Thesis is less developed and may deal with impact of either warfare or totalitarian regimes. • Organization is basic; argument on impact may be thin. • Essay shows imbalance; impact of warfare OR totalitarian regimes may be addressed. • Some of the major assertions are supported by references to works of art or art movements. • May contain a few errors that detract from the argument.  3–2 Points • No explicit thesis or a thesis that merely repeats or paraphrases the prompt.  • Organization is ineffective. • Essay shows serious imbalance; impact of warfare OR totalitarian regimes may be mentioned. • Little relevant evidence. • May contain several errors that detract from the argument.  1–0 Points • No discernible attempt at a thesis. • No discernible organization. • Impact of warfare and totalitarianism on art is neglected. • Minimal or no supporting evidence used.  • May contain numerous errors that detract from the argument.   Question 6 (continued)  Historical Background  Central elements of the question  • Analyze – determine component parts; examine their nature and relationship. • The arts may include painting, drawing, sculpture, music, literature, film, theater, etc. • Warfare’s effect on the arts: Textbooks usually deal with modernism as the ‘age of anxiety’ before World War I, which continues in a more aggravated form after the war. During the war and in the interwar period, German Expressionism, Surrealism, and Dadaism, are some of the movements students can use.  • Totalitarian regimes’ effect on the arts can deal with suppression and censorship, as well as use of propaganda. However, we cannot expect essays that identify specific “approved” works of art under Hitler or Stalin. They may describe the kind of posters or paintings these regimes liked, but not identify names. • Periodization is broad, 1900 to 1950 through the early part of the Cold War. We are accepting evidence in the 1950s if it is linked to warfare or to totalitarianism.  Some approaches to this question  Essays generally demonstrate knowledge of good examples of modernism in the arts; the issue here is to effectively discuss the impact of warfare and totalitarianism on art movements, works of art, or other forms of culture, and relate that to the historical context of the first half of the century. Argument is important to the question because the building blocks of a thesis are given in the prompt. However, some essays can drift off task. The responses need to be linked to the impact of the war and of totalitarian regimes. An essay that discusses totalitarianism without effectively treating the arts isn’t really responding to the question. Some essays don’t treat both aspects of the questions (warfare and totalitarianism), and some conflate the two. The quality of the argument and of the evidence is the main factor that distinguishes the higher quality responses.  Warfare  Specific and relevant evidence can be used to address the effects of warfare on art. Many essays deal first with the war (usually World War I) linking it to disillusion, despair, etc. Some essays effectively connect the war to Dadaism, Surrealism and German Expressionism, often using specific examples. In addition to evidence, the analysis of how the war affected the arts is going to determine the quality of the essay.   Totalitarianism  For totalitarianism, the chilling impact on the arts may be discussed, both through censorship of modernism, and use of ‘approved’ art as propaganda. For Hitler essays will sometimes refer to the concept of ‘Degenerate Art’ and some even mention the exhibition of that name. Stalin is less often addressed, but some essays refer to socialist realism. Otherwise, treatment of totalitarian impact on art will be more general, such as art as propaganda, or art serving the state.    Question 6 (continued)  Evidence  Modernism in the arts begins before World War I, so some textbooks treat it as part of the prewar “age of anxiety.” Some essays may feature inferences of the direct impact of the war on arts, while others refer to specific authors, such as Hemingway or Remarque. We have seen the use of Picasso’s Guernica, a highly relevant example that links to both warfare and totalitarianism. The use of pre-WWI evidence such as Demoiselles D’Avignon or Rite of Spring can be relevant as it may be used in an essay to show anticipation of the war, or how this prewar ‘anxiety’ heightens the impact of warfare. State manipulation of the arts, carried on effectively in both the Hitler and Stalin regimes, can be addressed in a variety of ways. Films such as Leni Reifenstahl’s Triumph of the Will are sometimes used and, more rarely, Sergei Eisenstein’s films, such as The Battleship Potemkin. Hitler’s extreme hostility to modernism is known, especially as he considered himself an artist. While many essays may not feature specific names, they do assess the ways in which the Nazi regime repressed creativity with labels such as “Degenerate art,” “Jewish art,” or “Bolshevik art.” Goebbels and other Nazi leaders’ efforts to mold all culture into the service of a German, “Aryan” racial model is sometimes mentioned. Similarly, Soviet “Socialist Realism” glorified the worker and rejected experimentation or the kind of rule-breaking that early modernism represented.    Abbreviated Chronology and Terminology of Modernism 1900 to circa1950  Note: the examples used here are not intended to be exhaustive. Many other writers, artists, poets, etc. could be used. Also note that many artists moved between movements over the course of their careers or produced works that spanned more than one movement.  Prewar Modernism • Influence of Freud and Nietzsche, as well as non-Western influences. “Age of Anxiety” turns its focus to the irrational. Post-Impressionism • Van Gogh Starry Night – 1889  Early Expressionism • Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff form the Brücke artists' group in Dresden, rejecting bourgeois social conventions and academic traditions in art – 1905  Cubism • Picasso Demoiselles D’Avignon – 1907 • Picasso, Guernica – 1937. Some essays use Guernica to blend the two aspects of the question: impact of warfare and impact of totalitarianism. This is acceptable.  Abstract art • Art that focuses on one or more of the visual elements of a subject: its line, shape, tone, pattern, texture, or form. Closely linked to Cubism. Begins 1900.   Question 6 (continued)  Futurism • Founded in Italy by Marinetti 1909. The Futurists were eager to break attachments to the past, and war, they felt, was an opportunity for a historical tabula rasa — a chance to wipe the slate clean, then create a new world order.  Der Blaue Reiter (the Blue Rider) • A group of artists whose publications and exhibitions sought to find a common creative ground between the various Expressionist art forms. Kandinsky, Marc, and Macke were among its founding members – 1911  German Expressionism • Kandinsky outlines the principles of abstraction in art in On the Spiritual in Art – 1912. • Leading German expressionists were Ludwig Kirchner, Oskar Kokoschka, George Grosz, and Emil Nolde.  Atonality and Other Experimentation in Music • Arnold Schoenberg, Pierrot Lunaire – 1912 • Igor Stravinsky’s composition The Rite of Spring for the Ballets Russes causes Paris riot – 1913 • Alban Berg, Lulu 1934  Modernism During and Between the Wars – Lost Generation • Impact of war on art: Many artists served but experienced loss of faith; pessimism; horror; grotesque nature of war; representations of the experience of the trenches. • Paul Nash The Ypres Salient at Night, 1917 striking painting of the war at night. • Otto Dix Prague Street – 1920 depicts wounded WWI veteran begging; Flanders – 1934 depicts the trenches of WWI; a response to the Nazi warmongering. • Max Ernst Elephant Celebes – 1921 (Ernst was in all three movements: Dadaism, Surrealism and German Expressionism.) • T.S. Eliot The Wasteland – 1922 modernism poem represents disillusionment of postwar generation. • Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises 1926. • Käthe Kollwitz Parents – 1932. A war memorial to her son who died in Flanders in 1914.  Dadaism (1916–1923) • Dada Manifesto (Hugo Ball) “Follow no rules!”; “anti-art” – 1916. • Marcel Duchamp – “readymades”. e.g., the 1917 Fountain (a urinal) and the 1919 L.H.O.O.Q. (Mona Lisa with a mustache). • Georges Grosz Berlin Street 1931 (technically from his post-Dada period, but can be used as an example).  Bauhaus School of Architecture • Founded by Walter Gropius – 1919   Question 6 (continued)  Surrealism (1924-1939) • André Breton’s first Surrealist Manifesto – 1924. French literary figures are involved: Paul Éluard, Guillaume Apollinaire. • Surrealism hoped to liberate the artist's imagination by tapping into the unconscious mind to discover a “superior” reality — a “sur-reality.” Emphasis on the unconscious and dreams (Freudian). • Salvador Dali The Persistence of Memory – 1931. • Franz Kafka, The Trial – 1925. Kafka’s writing is difficult to classify but may be viewed as manifestation of surrealism in literature.  Modernism in Cinema • Sergei Eisenstein deploys modernist film techniques in Battleship Potemkin – 1925 (may also be discussed under the rubric of totalitarianism’s impact on the arts). • Fritz Lang’s film Metropolis – 1926.  Totalitarian Governments React to Modernism  Both Nazi Germany (from 1933) and Stalinist Russia/USSR (from 1929) systematically suppressed modernism, imposed rigid controls on artists and intellectuals, and instituted systematic censorship.  • Both regimes opposed modernism and promoted art that supported its ideology: pure German types and neoclassicism for Hitler; socialist realism for Stalin.  • Totalitarian regimes required art with propaganda value, rejecting the individualism and experimentalism at the heart of the modernist program.  • Atonal music was rejected by Nazis as degenerate and Bolshevik, along with jazz and swing music (not pure and German.) The Bauhaus School was closed down. • The Nazis’ “Degenerate Art” exhibition ridiculed modernism – 1937. The Nazis prohibited modernist art and persecuted its practitioners (even Nolde who was a Nazi Party member). • Stalin imprisoned intellectuals, such as poet Osip Mandelstaum and novelist Boris Pasternak (both died in the Gulag) among many others.  • Author Yevgenia Ginzburg’s Journey into the Whirlwind recounts her time in the Gulag.  Note on Post-World War II Art  Some essays refer to evidence from the 1950s, which is acceptable as long as it is linked to the argument. Examples may include:  • Giacometti (Sculptor) Man Pointing – 1947; The Square II – 1948–49. Giacometti’s art features thin, elongated figures, like concentration camp survivors. • Samuel Beckett (Playwright) Endgame – 1958. Question 7  Analyze major factors that affected the changing balance of power among European states in the period 1848–1914.   9–8 Points • Thesis explains how various events and processes contributed to the changing balance of power between European states.  • Organization is clear, consistently followed, and effective in discussing at least two differing factors that changed the balance of power among European states in detail — either discussed together or separately. • Essay is well balanced, discussing multiple factors individually and at length. • Essay provides relevant and developed evidence of two or more factors affecting the balance of power. • May contain errors in fact or chronology that do not detract from the argument.  7–6 Points • Thesis states various events and processes that contributed to the changing balance of power between European states.  • Organization is clear and effective but possibly less consistent by providing [one fully developed and one or two less developed arguments] of factors that changed the balance of power among European states. • Essay is balanced, discussing multiple factors individually; though discussion of one or the other may be less in depth. • Essay provides relevant evidence of at least two factors affecting the balance of power. • May contain an error in fact or chronology that detracts from the argument.   5–4 Points • Thesis states one or more events and processes that affected the changing balance of power between European states. • Organization is clear and effective but less consistent by providing one developed and one or two less-developed arguments of factors affecting the changing the balance of power in Europe. • Essay may show some imbalance, being too narrative or succeeding in only one argument convincingly. • Essay provides evidence of one or two factors affecting balance of power, one possibly more developed than the other. • May contain a few errors in fact or chronology that detract from the argument.  3–2 Points • Thesis may restate prompt, possibly with limited reference to possible factors.   • Organization offers minimal argumentation of factors that changed the balance of power. • Essay may show serious imbalance, omitting or misconstruing parts of the prompt. • Essay may offer some evidence of factors affecting balance of power — be it vague or conflated. • May contain several errors in fact or chronology that detract from the argument.   Question 7 (continued)  1–0 Points • No discernible or negligible attempt at a thesis. • Organization is coincidental or offers no valid argumentation of factors affecting the balance of power. • Essay may show gross imbalance; parts of the prompt are ignored. • Essay may offer trivial or ineffectual evidence of factors affecting the balance of power. • May contain numerous errors in fact or chronology that detract from the argument.     Question 7 (continued)  Historical Background  The period between the failed revolutions of 1848 and the outbreak of the Great War in 1914 brought to an end the carefully crafted balance of power after the fall of Napoleon (1815 Congress of Vienna; Concert of European Powers) and the liberalist and romantic notions of statecraft. Nationalism and Realpolitik (pragmatic politics), as well as industrial might and imperialist zeal, conspired to forcefully shift power among the European States:   • The rise of new states   Italy (1858–1870), Germany (1864–1871) • The (re)assertion of power  France (1853–56 Crimean War; 1859 Austrian War, Unification Italy; expansion Indo-China)  Germany (1864 Danish War; 1866 Austro-Prussian War; 1870–71 Franco-Prussian War)  Great Britain (1899–1902 Boer War; expansion West Africa) • The retreat of power  Russia (1853–56 Crimean War; 1904–05 Russo-Japanese War)  Austria (1866 Austro-Prussian War; 1867 Ausgleich [compromise]–Dual Monarchy)  France (1870–71 Franco-Prussian War)  Ottoman Empire (Eastern Question; 1877–78 Russo Turkish war; 1878 Congress of Berlin) • Industrialization and economic assertion  Second Industrial Revolution; 1856 Bessemer converter[steel]; 1869 Suez Canal) • Imperialist tensions  Moroccan Crises (1905–06; 1911)  Balkan Crises (1908 Austrian Annexation Bosnia Herzegovina; 1912 First Balkan War)   • Diplomatic Alliances  Dual Alliance (1879 Germany – Austria)  Dreikaiserbund/Three Emperor’s League (1881–1887 Germany – Austria – Russia)  Reassurance Treaty (1887–1890 Germany – Russia)  Triple Alliance (1882 German – Austria – Italy)  Entente Cordiale 1904 (France – Great Britain)  Triple Entente 1907 (France – Great Britain – Russia)    In particular, responses are likely to address:  • The Crimean War (1853–56). Provoked by Napoleon III (France; reign: 1852–1871) in reassertion of French power after 1815 Congress of Vienna and in challenge to Russia’s central role in maintaining the balance of power in Europe. Russia’s humiliation over France’s 1852 success in obtaining the right to protect Christian shrines in Palestine (Russia was its Christian Orthodox protector), caused the latter to attempt to assert control over Constantinople and the Straits, resulting in its 1853 occupation of the Danubian Principalities and war with the Turks. British fears of Russian expansion and French aspirations of power sent an 1854 combined fleet to clear the Russians from the Black Sea. Austria, weary of a Slav uprising in its territory, managed to steer clear of the conflict and thus abandoned its former Russian ally. Russia’s 1856 defeat ended its prominent role in Europe (until reassertion in 1877), left Austria without an ally, and confirmed Britain’s naval hegemony, but it did not grant France the prominent position it had sought.   Question 7 (continued)  • The unification of Italy (1858–1870) After Giuseppe Mazzini’s (1805–1872) revolutionary efforts to oust the Austrians from the Italian peninsula had failed, consensus emerged that only war under the leadership of Piedmont Sardinia could achieve Italian unification. Piedmont Prime minister Count Camillo di Cavour (1810–1861) conspired with France (which was eager to protect its own interests) and provoked the 1859 Austrian War, a military triumph for the French. Although Napoleon III prematurely vied for peace for fear of provoking a full-scale Franco-Austrian war, he eventually did support unification, enabling Cavour through an 1860 series of public plebiscites (referendums) to annex the Northern States. After revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi’s (1807–1882) thousand Red Shirts staged a successful 1860 invasion of Sicily and marched on Naples, Cavour was forced to annex the remainder of Italy (minus Rome), ratifying by 1861 plebiscite, the Kingdom of Italy with (Piedmont) King Victor Emanuel II (1849–1878) as sovereign. The 1866 Austro-Prussian War ended Austrian influence and handed Venetia to the Italians; the 1870–71 Franco-Prussian War ended French protection of Rome and completed unification.   • The unification Germany (1864–1871). After the failed 1848–49 German unification “from the top,” it was clear that only after Austrian influence was curtailed in favor of Prussian primacy, could one set out to unify the German confederacy. Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck (1815–1889) sought to weaken Austrian influence by both renewing the Austria-excluded Prussian Zollverein (tax union) and drawing Austria into an administrative conflict over Schleswig and Hollstein (1864 Prusso-Austrian rebuke of Danish incorporation of Schleswig). The attempt to exclude Austria from the German Confederation provoked the 1866 Prusso-Austrian War, which ended Austrian influence over German affairs without further indemnity. Bypassing parliamentary resistance to military reform (Blood and Steel reference), Bismarck professionalized and expanded Prussian forces. His quandary of how to unite the previously Catholic, pro-Austrian South, was resolved through the succession crisis in Spain (ouster of Isabella II (r. 1843–1868)), when French fears of Prussian European dominance caused Napoleon III to overreach. Bismarck manipulated media accounts of the Prussian-French negotiations over the succession to the Spanish throne to create the public impression that France had been snubbed, prompting Napoleon III to declare war on Prussia. The French 1870 declaration of war unified southern German (Catholic) states behind Prussian leadership, and the 1871 Prussian victory shifted the power decisively from France to Germany, now united under Prussian hegemony.  • The establishment of the Dual Monarchy – The Austro-Hungarian Ausgleich (1867; compromise). The eroding influence of the Habsburg Monarchy and waxing assertion of Magyar nobility forced Austria to embrace dualism, granting limited or collaborative powers to Hungary.   • The disintegration Ottoman Empire – The Eastern Question – The ‘Sick Man of Europe’ The stature of Ottoman Turkey had been in slow decline due, in part, to nationalist assertions for independence (1878 Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria) and Western Imperialism (Russia-Crimea, Caucasus; France-Algeria). The 1853–56 Crimean War exposed the Empire’s military weakness. Russian Pan-Slavism led to the 1875 Balkan insurrections and Russian territorial expansion in the ensuring 1877–78 Russo Turkish war. Bismarck, fearing further Russian assertions and possibly an Anglo-Russian war, commenced the 1878 Congress of Berlin in which Western powers effectively divided the spoils of imperialism and ensured the Ottoman Empire’s disintegration (giving way to the 1911 First Balkan War).     Question 7 (continued)  • New Imperialism – Colonialism Industrial innovation in transport and weaponry colluded with nationalism and imperial rivalry to fuel a drive for colonies in the 1880’s. Western powers invested heavily in opening new territory to exploration and exploitation, particularly in Africa and Asia. The 1885 Berlin Conference both regulated the quickly accumulated territory of King Leopold II (Belgium, r. 1865–1909) in the Congo, and set off a 15-year scramble for Africa. The Dutch vastly expanded control of the East Indies (now Indonesia) while France (Indo-China), and Great Britain (India), and Russia (central and East Asia) further consolidated interests. These expansions inevitably led to Inter-European rivalries exemplified in the 1905–06/1911 Moroccan Crises, and the 1905 Russo Japanese War.  • The Alliance System To ensure German security and balance of power in Europe, Bismarck set out to forge a series of alliances. The 1879 Dual Alliance with Austria strengthened control over Mitteleuropa (Middle Europe) and gave rise to (misplaced) Austrian hopes of control over the Balkans. Russia’s renewed power after the Crimean disaster forced Austria to accept the 1881–1887 Dreikaiserbund (Three Emperor’s League), which gave Russia renewed control over the Straits (the 1887–1890 Reassurance Treaty was its successor, minus Austria) and renewed zeal in Balkan affairs. The 1882 Triple Alliance with Italy and Austria completed Bismarck’s attempts to isolate France. However, Balkan succession quarrels strained Russo-Austrian relations and Russo-French rapprochement, resulting in 1904 Entente Cordiale between France and Great Britain and the 1911 Triple Entente including Russia.           AP® European History 2014 Scoring Guidelines      © 2014 The College Board.
