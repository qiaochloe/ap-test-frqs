Question 1—Document-Based Question   Analyze the causes of and responses to the peasants’ revolts in the German states, 1524–1526.  BASIC CORE: 1 point each to a total of 6 points  1. Provides an appropriate, explicitly stated thesis that directly addresses all parts of the question. Thesis must not simply restate the question.   The thesis must make some effort to address both causes and responses with some degree of specificity (beyond general analytical categories) for at least one part of the prompt. The thesis must suggest a minimal level of analysis or context drawn from the documents. The thesis need not appear in the first paragraph.  2. Discusses a majority of the documents individually and specifically. The student must be discuss at least seven documents—even if used incorrectly—by reference to anything in the box. Documents cannot be referenced together in order to get credit for this point (e.g., “Documents 1, 4, and 6 suggest …”). Documents can be cited by number or by name, or they can be referenced in other ways that make it clear which document is being discussed.   3. Demonstrates understanding of the basic meaning of a majority of the documents (may misinterpret no more than one).  A student may not significantly misinterpret more than one document. A major misinterpretation is an incorrect analysis or one that leads to an inaccurate grouping or a false conclusion.   4. Supports the thesis with appropriate interpretations of a majority of the documents. The student must use at least seven documents, and the documents used in the body of the essay must provide support for the thesis. A student cannot earn this point if no credit was awarded for point 1 (appropriate thesis).  5. Analyzes point of view or bias in at least three documents. The student must make a reasonable effort to explain why a particular source expresses the stated view by: • Relating authorial point of view to author’s place in society (motive, position, status, etc.) OR • Evaluating the reliability of the source OR • Recognizing that different kinds of documents serve different purposes OR • Analyzing the tone of the documents; must be well developed  Note: (1) Attribution alone is not sufficient to earn credit for point of view. (2) It is possible for students to discuss point of view collectively, but this counts for only one of the three point of views. Question 1—Document-Based Question (continued)  6. Analyzes documents by explicitly organizing them in at least three appropriate groups. A group must contain at least two documents that are used correctly and individually. Groupings and corresponding documents may include the following (not exclusive):  • Causes:  o Dissatisfaction/demands in general: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 o Revolt against princes: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11 o Oppression by lords and princes: 2, 3, 8, 9 o Religious influences: 1, 3, 4, 6 o End to serfdom: 2, 3, 4 o Economic relief: 2, 3, 8  • Responses:  o Condemnation: 1, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12 o Riots/plundering: 5, 6, 7, 11 o Peasants’ responses: 2, 3, 6 o Towns’ responses: 4, 5, 9 o Nobles’ responses: 8, 10, 11, 12 o Lay religious figures/favorable responses: 2, 6 o Religious authorities/negative responses: 5, 7, 8 o Empathy: 2, 5, 9 o Appeasement: 4, 10, 11 o Favorable: 2, 3, 6, 9 o Unfavorable: 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12  EXPANDED CORE: 0–3 points to a total of 9 points  Expands beyond the basic core of 1–6. The basic score of 6 must be achieved before a student can earn expanded core points. Credit awarded in the expanded core should be based on holistic assessment of the essay. Factors to consider in holistic assessment may include:  • Has a clear, analytical, and comprehensive thesis • Uses all or almost all of the documents (11–12 documents) • Uses the documents persuasively as evidence • Shows understanding of nuances of the documents • Analyzes point of view or bias in at least four documents cited in the essay • Analyzes the documents in additional ways (e.g., develops more groupings) • Recognizes and develops change over time • Brings in relevant “outside” information  Question 1—Document-Based Question (continued)  A CLOSER LOOK AT POINT OF VIEW IN THE 2008 DBQ  There are many means by which a student can demonstrate point-of-view analysis in the 2008 DBQ. Students must make a reasonable effort to address point of view by referring to at least three documents.   Examples of ACCEPTABLE point-of-view analysis  Relating authorial point of view to author’s place in society “Leonard von Eck, as a chancellor, would likely hold this view since as a government official he is probably very concerned with preserving order and the stability of the political structure (doc. 1).”  “Since Martin Luther had been deemed a heretic and was dependent upon local princes for protection, it is not surprising that he would be so vehement in condemning events that many linked to him and that were causing such civil unrest (doc. 7).”  Evaluating the reliability of the source “Lichtenstein may not be a completely reliable source, however, since he was pleading his own case and clearly had something to gain (doc. 10).”  “Since Caspar Nutzel is a local government official writing to a superior, his acknowledgement of ‘excessive’ actions by authorities seems credible since it may have been somewhat risky to offer criticism of authority during this time period (doc. 9).”  Recognizing that different kinds of documents serve different purposes“It is important to note that Lorenz Fries is commenting in a secret report probably not meant for publication; therefore, he is likely able to be more frank and honest than he might have been in a public document (doc. 8).”  “The demands of the Peasant Parliament of Swabia were announced in Articles of the Peasants of Memmingen to the Town Council; since these demands came from a group of peasants, it is reasonable to assume that these were widely held views among the peasantry of this area (doc. 3).”  Analyzing the tone of the documents: “The passionate tone of Muntzer’s open letter was clearly designed to incite further reaction among an already agitated peasant population” (What counts here is not merely the mention of “tone” but a clear link to the intention of the author).  Examples of UNACCEPTABLE point-of-view analysis: “Count Wilhelm von Hennenberg, in a letter to Duke Albert of Prussia, noted that nobles were surprised when peasants turned from attacking priests and monks to the property of the nobility (doc. 11).” Why is this unacceptable? This is merely attribution with no attempt at further analysis beyond the stated information from the document itself; the statement does not explain why Hennenberg held these views.  “Because this is a statement written by two preachers, it accurately reflects the attitudes of the people during this time period (doc. 5).” Why is this unacceptable? Again, this is really just attribution, since the statement makes no effort to explain how or why these two preachers would be authoritative voices of the people. Question 1—Document-Based Question (continued)  “The reply of the Memmingen Town Council to the Articles of the Peasants of Memmingen was biased when they stated that serfdom is no hindrance to salvation (doc. 4).” Why is this unacceptable? This statement merely asserts that the Town Council is biased, with no attempt to explain why they may hold a biased view; the second part of the statement is simply a reference to the content of the document.  “Lorenz Fries writes a secret report to the archbishop to explain that a peasant assembly in Wurzburg believed that the rich should share with the poor (doc. 8).” Why is this unacceptable? While it may be relevant that this was a secret report, this statement makes no attempt to explain why this may be significant in the interpretation of the document.  Question 1 Document Summary  Document 1: Leonhard von Eck, Chancellor of Bavaria, report to Duke Ludwig of Bavaria, February 15, 1525 “This rebellion has been undertaken to repress princes and nobility and has its ultimate source in Lutheran teaching, for the peasants relate the majority of their demands to the Word of God … The peasants are blinded … and made witless.” The peasants cannot be trusted.  Document 2: Sebastian Lotzer, craftsperson and lay preacher, and Christoph Schappeler, preacher from Memmingen, Twelve Articles of the Swabian Peasants, March 1, 1525 “We will no longer allow ourselves … to be oppressed by our lords. … We will let them demand only what is just and proper according to the agreement between lords and peasants. Lords should no longer try to force more services or other dues from peasants without compensation. Peasants should … help lords … at proper times and for a suitable compensation.”  Document 3: Peasant Parliament of Swabia to the Memmingen Town Council, from Articles of the Peasants of Memmingen, March 3, 1525 We have been your serfs despite the redemption of Christ for us just as for the Emperor. We do not “reject all authority. We will be obedient to all authority appointed by God … we do not doubt that as Christian lords you will release us from serfdom.”  Document 4: Reply of the Memmingen Town Council to the Articles of the Peasants of Memmingen, March 15, 1525 We have “purchased” your serfdom “for a considerable sum … and … serfdom is no hindrance to … salvation. …” As a gesture of “good will,” we will “absolve” you of your “serfdom” in exchange for “reasonable” payment.  Document 5: Pastor Johann Herolt, report of the events at Weinsburg, April 16, 1525 The peasants “unexpectedly” captured the count’s family and “plundered the castle” while he was away. When the peasants “appeared before the town,” the townsfolk supported the peasants and “opened” the town “gates … to … let them in.”  Document 6: Thomas Müntzer, preacher and theologian, open letter to the people of Allstedt, April 27, 1525 “How long are you going to resist God’s will? The whole of Germany, France, and Italy are awake. Four abbeys were laid waste during Easter week. More peasants in the Black Forest have risen. … Hammer away on the anvils of princes and lords.”  Document 7: Martin Luther, theologian, Against the Murdering, Thieving Hordes of Peasants, Wittenberg, May 1525 The peasants are out of control and “raging like mad dogs.” Their “assertions” in the “Twelve Articles were nothing but lies presented under the name of the Gospel.” This is the “work of that devil, Thomas Müntzer. … The peasants are not content with belonging to the devil themselves; they force … [others] to join. … Anyone who consorts with them goes to the devil with them and is guilty of … [their] evil deeds.”  Document 8: Lorenz Fries, chief advisor to the Archbishop of Würzburg, secret report regarding a peasant assembly, June 1, 1525 “[P]easants occupying Würzberg” believe “the rich should share with the poor, especially those” who profited from the poor. Similar ideas were heard in the “countryside,” causing many “prosperous” men to begin expressing concern over the uprisings.  Question 1 Document Summary (continued)  Document 9: Caspar Nützel, Nürnberg town councilor, letter to Duke Albert of Prussia, August 5, 1525 “May God grant that the peace be preserved. … [I]gnorant peasants have overstepped the mark with their unseemly behavior” though “the authorities” have also been unreasonable, “unchristian,” and excessive to those “whom they should aid … rather than fleece.”  Document 10: Christoffel von Lichtenstein, nobleman, legal plea for leniency to Count Wilhelm von Hennenberg, August 24, 1525 “Many … nobles … joined the peasants” in order to save their lives and property. “I begged that the peasants should not force me to swear an oath of allegiance” since I had “done them no harm … [but] I had to swear the oath.”  Document 11: Count Wilhelm von Hennenberg, letter to Duke Albert of Prussia,  February 2, 1526 “At first the nobility … [were] pleased … that the rebellion attacked the priests and monks,” but they were caught unawares when the peasants turned upon the houses of the nobility, taking everything they found and burning houses to the ground.  Document 12: Decree of the Imperial Diet of Speyer, August 27, 1526 “[H]is Imperial Majesty … commanded … [an] examination” of the recent “rebellion … so that such disturbance … [could] be prevented in the future.” Despite the violent actions of the “common man,” each authority has the “power to restore to their … estate[s] … those subjects who have surrendered unconditionally” in order to demonstrate grace and compassion.  Question 2  Analyze the methods and degrees of success of Russian political and social reform from the period of Peter the Great (1689–1725) through Catherine the Great (1762–1796).  9–8 Points • Thesis is explicit and responds fully to the prompt; thesis may not appear in the opening paragraph. o Methods and degrees of success are explicitly defined. o Thesis demonstrates or supports an analytical approach by noting the complexity of the methods and/or degrees of success of the reforms. • Organization is clear and consistently followed, is effective in support of the argument, and may follow a variety of analytical approaches: o Chronological (coverage extends beyond the reign of a single monarch). o Tasks of the prompt (methods of reform and degrees of success of the reforms). o Type of reform (political reform, social reform). • Essay is relatively balanced; all topics are covered at length. o Provides longer discussion of the reforms of one monarch but also includes adequate coverage of the entire era. o Other topics/policies (e.g., territorial expansion during the time period) are directly linked to methods and/or the degrees of success of reform. • Major assertions regarding the methods and degrees of success of political and social reform are supported with multiple pieces of evidence. o Specific evidence (policies) is clearly linked to methods and/or degrees of success of political and social reforms. • May contain errors or off-topic content that do not detract from the argument.  7–6 Points • Thesis is explicit and responsive to the question. o Methods and degrees of success of reform are identified but with language that is less sophisticated and/or more generalized. • Essay is organized and supports the argument but may on occasion stray off task. o May at times describe reforms but contains some analysis. o May conflate political and social reforms. • Essay is relatively balanced; all major topics suggested by the prompt are covered at least briefly. o Discusses methods and degrees of success unevenly but must touch upon both. o May give greater emphasis to the reforms of one era or monarch but contains some discussion of the reforms beyond the reign of a single ruler. o May conflate political and social reforms but discusses at least one reform from each category. • Major assertions regarding the methods and the degrees of success of the political and social reforms during the period are supported by at least ONE piece of relevant evidence. • May contain an error or off-topic discussion that detracts from the argument but does not significantly interfere with the tasks of the essay (e.g., the emancipation of the serfs and/or the degrees of success of the reforms).  Question 2 (continued)  5–4 Points • Thesis is explicit but not fully responsive to the question.  o It may not explicitly address all relevant prompts (methods and degrees of success of the reforms, the period from the late seventeenth through the late eighteenth centuries); OR o It may respond satisfactorily to one task but not the other (analysis of methods and degrees of success of political and social reforms); OR o A substantial part of the thesis lists policies without attempting to address the prompts of the question. • Essay is organized but may not always address the requirements of the question. o May provide an account of events of the period with minimal efforts to link to the concept of reform. o Attempt to respond to the tasks is narrative rather than analytical. o Analysis may be broadly and superficially stated. o May include off-task information or discussion of policies and/or events. • Essay shows some imbalance; some major topics suggested by the prompt are neglected. o May focus on one of the tasks (analysis of methods of reform and degrees of success of reform) and neglect or ignore the other task. o May only consider one type of reform (political, social) and neglect the other. o May provide evidence and information about the reforms of part of the period only. o Linkage between accurate information on policies and the concept of reform is minimal. • Most major assertions regarding the political and social reforms of the period and the methods and the degree of success of the reforms are supported by at least one piece of relevant evidence. • May contain a few errors and off-task discussions that detract from the argument.  3–2  Points • Contains no explicit thesis OR the thesis may be irrelevant OR inaccurate OR largely a paraphrase of the prompts of the thesis. • Essay is poorly organized and ineffective. o Essay may devote much attention to the personal lives of monarchs and contain a significant amount of off-topic material. o Essay may simply be a narrative of events. • Essay shows serious imbalance, since most major topics suggested by the prompt are neglected. o May demonstrate little or no knowledge of the chronology. o May not provide linkage between policies and the concept of reform. • Few assertions are supported with relevant evidence. • May contain several errors that detract from the argument.  1–0 Points • Essay lacks any discernable attempt at a thesis, OR the thesis fails to address the specific prompts of the question. • Disorganized response that suggests little or no understanding of the question. • Ignores most of the major topics suggested by the question. • Offers little or no relevant supporting evidence. • May contain numerous errors that detract from the argument.    Question 2 Historical Background  Material in this section is derived from the following texts:  Cannistraro and Reich, The Western Perspective (2nd edition, 2004) Hunt, The Making of the West (2nd edition, 2005) Kagan, The Western Heritage (9th edition, 2007) Kishlansky, Civilization in the West (7th edition, 2008) McKay, A History of Western Society (9th edition, 2008) Merriman, Modern Europe from the Renaissance to the Present (2nd edition, 2004) Spielvogel, Western Civilization Since 1300 (6th edition, 2006)  Reforms of Peter the Great (1689–1725): generally placed within the context of the development of absolutism and/or state-building during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.  • Military reforms—“Peter’s greatest reforms were military” (Kishlansky). o The creation of a standing army along western models and trained by foreign officers. o The development of a Russian navy originally trained by foreign officers. o Great Northern War (1700–1721): victory over Sweden made Russia the leading power in the Baltic and a force in European politics. o Lifetime service in the military (sometimes simply described as lifetime service to the state) demanded from nobles and peasants (one text notes the term of service for the peasants was 25 years). o The establishment of schools of artillery, engineering, and military medicine. o The disbanding of the old military units (streltsy).  • Administrative reforms o The creation of a new capital, the city of St. Petersburg, begun in 1703; usually cited as evidence of Peter’s determination to integrate Russia into the rest of Europe. o The employment of foreigners in the Russian bureaucracy, although the emphasis in the textbooks is on the role of foreigners in the training of the Russian military. o The establishment of the Table of Ranks (1722), a hierarchy of posts in the military and civil administration, with promotion based on merit (one major textbook describes the reform without identifying it by name). o Creation of the Senate, a committee of administrators who governed the country during Peter’s absence and supervised other agencies of government. o Creation of government bureaus called colleges to deal with specific aspects of policy. o Division of the empire into 50 provinces.  • Ecclesiastical reform o The abolition of the patriarch, the religious head of the Russian Orthodox Church. o The establishment of the Holy Synod to administer the Church as the state desired (Kagan describes the reform as “the most radical transformation of a traditional institution in Peter’s reign”). o The Orthodox Church lost its independence; the position of patriarch remained absent after 1700, church property was administered by the state, and priests became state employees.  o The Orthodox Church was secularized and much of its wealth seized by the state. o The state gained control of the clergy while still supporting established religion; bishops pledged not to interfere in state affairs.  Question 2 Historical Background (continued)  • Economic and fiscal reforms o The monarchy imposed a “soul” or poll tax on all males (one textbook mentions only the serfs). o Higher taxes were imposed on the population (two texts mention a three-fold increase in taxation). o The state raised revenues through a variety of indirect taxes and state monopolies; tobacco, rhubarb, and dice are often offered as examples. o The state promoted economic growth in order to raise revenue by the adoption of mercantilist policies (texts vary on the degree of specificity). Mining, as well as the effort to export manufactured goods, is noted by some sources. o The state introduced the cultivation of new products like the potato. o The state began construction of a merchant fleet.  • Educational reforms o The monarchy established a number of schools designed to supply the regime with trained officers and bureaucrats. The degree of specificity varies from broad statements about military and engineering schools to the School of Navigation and Mathematics (founded in 1701) in Moscow and the Academy of Sciences (established in 1725) in St. Petersburg. o Sons of the nobility were sent abroad to study in western universities. o A noble was required to receive a five-year education away from home. o Translations of western classics were commissioned by the state. o First Russian newspaper was issued in 1703.  • Russian aristocracy o Peter imposed the concept of lifetime and compulsory service to the state. o Peter began the process of westernization of the Russian nobility (e.g., the shaving of beards and the imposition of western clothing). o Aristocratic women were required to attend social functions; women no longer were required to wear veils in public. o A book on proper etiquette was published by the Russian state. o A noble was required to receive a five-year education away from home.  • Russian peasantry—“Peasantry was the most abused in Europe” (Kagan). o Lifetime service was imposed on all Russians by the tsar’s government. o Peasantry was drafted for military service. o Peasantry was conscripted for the construction of St. Petersburg, costing the deaths of thousands of peasant workers.  • Opposition/degrees of success—“Absolute rule was never as powerful in practice as it was in theory” (Kishlansky). o After Peter’s reforms, Russia became a European power. o Reforms increased the burdens of the lower classes who came to distrust westernization as a result. o Opposition to the tsar’s reforms existed within Russian society (the tsar’s heir, some aristocrats, some clergy, peasants, traditionalists). o Government remained inefficient and corrupt. o Succession was not assured; palace coups plagued Russia after Peter’s death. o Some historians see westernization as a “sham” because it only affected the nobility.   Question 2 Historical Background (continued)  The period 1725–1762 is given minimal treatment in western civilization textbooks; some describe the era as one that was characterized by palace coups and ineffective rulers.  Reforms of Catherine the Great (1762–1796): reforms and policies are generally placed within the context of the Enlightenment and/or enlightened despotism.  • Military reforms o Textbooks do not associate Catherine with any reforms of the Russian military. They credit her with continuing the policy of territorial expansion, sometimes explicitly noting the link to Peter the Great. o Catherine played a vital role in the three partitions of Poland. o Territorial expansion in the South (such as the Crimea) came at the expense of the Ottoman Empire.  • Administrative/legal reforms o Catherine corresponded with philosophes (Voltaire, Denis Diderot). Her Instructions to the Legislative Commission borrowed heavily from the writings of philosophes like Charles Montesquieu and Cesare Beccaria. The Instructions advocated equality before the law and questioned serfdom, torture, and capital punishment. o The Legislative Commission was summoned to codify Russian law and reform the governance of the country. No code of laws or radical reform took place. o In 1775, the empress undertook reform of local government. The empire was divided into about 50 provinces, and local administration was left in the hands of the nobility.  • Ecclesiastical reforms o Catherine secularized all church land and made the clergy servants of the state, a development not mentioned in many western civilization textbooks. o The empress ended the persecution of the Old Believers, an Orthodox sect created in the mid-seventeenth century during the Great Schism. o After the First Russo–Turkish War (1768-74), Catherine claimed to serve as the protector of Orthodox Christians living in the Ottoman Empire.  • Economic and fiscal reforms (little mention in the textbooks) o One textbook identifies Catherine’s economic policies as a continuation of Peter’s work. Exports (grain, flax, furs, naval stores) increased, and internal barriers to trade were removed. o A second textbook simply states that Catherine and other eighteenth-century monarchs attempted to collect enough tax revenues to support their standing armies.  • Educational reforms o The empress attempted to provide formal education for women (one text specifies the daughters of the nobility). o The government established provincial elementary schools, engineering schools, and a college intended to train teachers for Russia’s new schools. o Catherine allowed for the publication of more books during her reign, although the French Revolution resulted in a sudden shift. The regime tightened censorship in its last years. Question 2 Historical Background (continued)  • Nobility o In 1785 the empress issued the Charter of the Nobility (1785), acknowledging the rights and privileges of the Russian aristocracy. Nobles were exempted from taxation, granted “considerable” or “complete” control over their peasants, and released from compulsory state service (although some texts indicate that local service was now expected). The nobility received the freedom to travel abroad without the permission of the state, their property rights were now secure, and they could petition the monarchy directly. Finally, they were protected from corporal punishment and if charged with a crime were to be tried by their peers. o Local administration was left in the hands of the nobility.  • Peasantry o Catherine extended serfdom into new areas such as Ukraine and gave away villages of state peasants to favorites, perhaps as many as 800,000 according to one text. o The empress placed control of the serfs in the hands of the nobility. o Resentment of the burdens imposed by the nobility and the state led to the Pugachev Revolt (1773-75). The revolt was the culmination of growing peasant unrest during the 1760s. The uprising was crushed, but the revolt destroyed any plans for improving the life of the peasantry. Catherine became increasingly oppressive afterwards. After 1789, the books of the philosophes were banned, and critics of the social order were exiled to Siberia.  • Opposition/degree of success o Catherine, like other Eastern European monarchs of the time, sought to strengthen the state by the application of reason to her policies. Historians still disagree about the sincerity of her advocacy for reform. Was she sincere or did she hope to shape public opinion in Western Europe? o The empress believed Russia could only be governed effectively by an autocrat but recognized that Russia could only remain a great power by some reforms of her institutions and society. She was not prepared, however, to risk radical reform. o A variety of factors are cited as obstacles to reform: the empress’s background, the manner by which she came to power, the need for the continuing support of the nobility, and the size and complexity of the country she governed. o Like Frederick II and Joseph II, two Eastern European enlightened despots, Catherine was prepared to encourage greater prosperity and happiness if such developments also strengthened the state. o The empress, although she valued favorable publicity from her contact with the philosophes, remained skeptical of many of their proposals.

However, this turning point has roots that lie in the distant past and the prior century. Events from the Age of Enlightenment through the period of the French Revolution of 1789 and even the Napoleonic era directly influenced the change in women’s lives during the nineteenth century. Writers like Olympe de Gouges and Mary Wollstonecraft produced works that directly influenced how women were both regarded by others and thought of themselves far into the nineteenth century.  Nonetheless, the opening decades of the century found women’s lives to be similar to what had been in place throughout much of the eighteenth century. However, the growth of the Industrial Revolution quickly began to change this. By the 1830s, women and children made up more than two-thirds of the labor force in the cotton industry (this number dropped only slightly, to approximately 50 percent, by 1870). As common laborers, they were mostly unskilled and were paid less than half of a man’s wages for similar work. In Great Britain excessive working hours for women were outlawed in the mines and textile factories in 1844, and by 1867, they were outlawed in craft shops.  The employment of large numbers of women in factories did not produce a significant transformation in female working patterns, as was once assumed. Throughout the nineteenth century in France and Britain, traditional types of female labor were still the norm. In 1851, nearly 40 percent of the female workforce in Britain engaged in domestic service, while in France about 40 percent was involved in agriculture. British accounts indicate that only 20 percent of the female workforce was employed by factories, and in France the proportion employed in factories was only 10 percent. Most of these working women were single; few married women worked outside the home. The various Factory Acts passed in the middle of the century in Great Britain limited the hours of employment for children and women and began to break up the traditional work patterns. Men were regarded as the primary breadwinners, and women assumed daily control of the family and sought low-paying jobs, such as laundry, that could be done in the home. The growth of a middle class increased the need for a domestic service industry and made it possible for women to be employed during the day and return home to their families in the evening. The lowest class of unskilled female workers often lived on the edge of survival. Here women had to work to help support a family and were often employed at home doing piecework, or in the sweatshops of the urban garment-trade industry.  Throughout most of the century, marriage was viewed as the only occupation acceptable for most women. An increasing proportion of women chose or were compelled by circumstances to marry rather than remain single, and in many regions women tended to marry at younger ages than previously. Thus, births out of wedlock declined. The advent of vulcanized rubber in the late 1840s made possible both the condom and the diaphragm, which lowered the birth rate and gave some women greater control over their reproductive patterns.   The legal codes of most European countries in the early nineteenth century gave few rights to women; in particular, married women surrendered most of what rights they had as single women to their husbands. Early movements to grant rights to married women did not fare well. Divorce was not legalized in Britain until 1857, and married women were not granted the right to own property until 1870. France finally permitted a limited divorce law in 1884. Catholic countries like Spain and Italy did not grant any such rights in the nineteenth century.  New ideas regarding education made it possible for women to learn “domestic crafts,” such as singing and piano playing, to educate the family and provide home entertainment.  Question 5 Historical Background (continued)  As the century progressed, the spread of higher-paying jobs in heavy industry tended to eliminate the need for many married women to work to supplement the family income. However, the increased need for clerical jobs opened other opportunities. At the same time, middle- and working-class women in many countries began agitating for greater legal and political rights  The middle of the century also saw the beginning of compulsory education. The skilled labor required by the Second Industrial Revolution demanded a new generation of laborers who were better educated, and this required more teachers. Teaching was commonly regarded as a socially acceptable occupation for women; hence new job opportunities became available for women in education.   The mass leisure culture that developed near the end of the century opened doors for actresses (e.g., Sarah Bernhardt). Music and dance halls likewise began to proliferate from the 1850s onward, giving women more opportunities as entertainers. The growth of participatory and spectator sports also opened a wider range of socially acceptable activities for women (for instance, ladies’ football was sanctioned in Britain in 1895).   Women’s Activities Involving Change in the Nineteenth Century  Nineteenth-Century Women • Sarah Bernhardt (1844–1923): famous actress.  • Florence Nightingale: nurse. • Amalie Sieveking Hamburg: nurse. • Emmeline Pankhurst and Christabel Pankhurst: Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU) founders; confrontational approach to gaining rights. • Flora Tristan: socialist. • Millicent Fawcett (1847–1929): favored peaceful negotiations for legal rights (1847–1929). • Marie Curie (1867–1934): physicist; discovered polonium (1898). • Ingebord Schroder: Swedish gymnast (1880s) (reference 2006 DBQ).  • Josephine Butler (and the Shrieking Sisters): prostitution reform. • Octavia Hill: housing reform. • Famous female monarchs: Victoria I of England (1837–1901) and Isabella II of Spain (1833-68).  Books and Paintings  • Mary Wollstonecraft: A Vindication of the Rights of Women (1792). • Olympe de Gouges: Declaration of the Rights of Women and the Citizeness (1789). • Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley: Frankenstein (1818). • Charlotte Bronte: Jane Eyre (1847). • Jane Austen (d. 1817): Pride and Prejudice (1813). • George Eliot: female writer. • George Sand: female writer. • Émile Zola: Germinal (about mines). • Henrik Ibsen: A Doll’s House (about oppressed woman). • Édouard Manet: The Railroad (women being denied access). • Gustave Caillebotte: Le Pont de l’Europe (women as the property of men). • Pierre-Auguste Renoir: La Loge de l’Opera (women in the theater). • Henri de Toulouse Lautrec: bar scenes showing greater social freedom for women.  Question 5 Historical Background (continued)  Employment • Governess, clerks, typists, telephone operators, teachers, actresses, nurses, athletes.  • The “New Woman” of the mid- to late-1800s increasingly became a breadwinner, often by doing office work. • Note: factory work, mines, prostitution, domestic servants, seamstress/dressmaker, and scientist are not solely nineteenth century.  In the Home (differentiated by class) • Many roles did not change: wife, child bearing, child rearing, housekeeper, cook. • Cult of Domesticity; Victorian “Angel in the House”: wife/mother as moral guardian and instructor of the family. • Possible increase in premarital sex (especially in urban areas) but also greater use of birth control.    Divorce Rights (1857 in England; allowed in cases of cruelty) • Women gained more status as property owners. • Ideal of affectionate marriage placed greater emphasis on respect for wives. • The rise of mass consumerism gave women greater economic power.  Laws that Affected the Status of Women • 1844: Mines Act (Great Britain). • 1844: Factory Act (Great Britain) protected women workers. • 1864: Contagious Diseases Act (Great Britain) required medical exam for prostitutes (repealed 1886). o No law against prostitution; moral pressure against it. • 1870s: Ferry Laws (France) formed the basis for compulsory education. • 1875: Factory Act (Great Britain) reduced workweek to 56 hours. • 1875: Artisans Dwelling Act (Great Britain) defined unsanitary housing; state inspection.   Organizations and Movements Important for Women • Great Britain: WSPU (Suffragettes), 1867. • Germany: the General German Women’s Association, 1865. • France: the Society for the Demand for Women’s Rights, 1866.  • Sweden: The Association for Married Women’s Property Rights, 1873.   • There were also women’s rights groups in Russia from the 1860s and in Italy from the 1890s.  • Temperance movement. • Antislavery movement.    Important Suffrage Dates In various European countries, women were given the right to vote as follows: • Sweden, 1862. • Finland, 1863, conditional on property ownership; 1872, unconditional voting rights. • Bohemia, 1864, conditional on property ownership. • Britain, 1869, widows allowed to vote in local elections.  • Austria Hungary, (various dates) women given the vote in local elections.  BUT women were not given the general right to vote in most European countries until well into the twentieth century. Question 5 Historical Background (continued)  Causes from the Eighteenth Century  NOTE: Causes from the eighteenth century must be clearly linked to the nineteenth century. Increased urbanization, the Industrial Revolution, and the Agricultural Revolution, as well as associated changes for women began before 1800, especially in Britain.  Enlightenment • Salons give educated women a voice in cultural affairs.  • Emilie du Chatelet (female scientist and enlightened thinker). • Mme du Pompadour, Mlle de Lespinasse, Mme d’Alembert ran salons.  • Mary Wollstonecraft. • Olympe de Gouges.  French Revolutionary Rights  • Divorce and property rights taken away by Napoleonic Code; not fully restored until 1881. • March to Versailles.  • Political clubs (Jacobin Society for Women) closed down during Reign of Terror.  Scientific Revolution • Female scientists.  Question 6  Analyze the major factors responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism in nineteenth-century Europe.  9–8 Points • Thesis must be explicit and address causality (a factor can be a large development such as nationalism or Social Darwinism; an issue related to the economic or religious status of Jews; or an event, like the Dreyfus Affair). • Organization is clear, consistently followed, and effective in support of the argument. • Essay is well balanced.

Responses may include references to events that occurred in the late-eighteenth century (Jewish Emancipation in the Hapsburg Empire or France) or the early-twentieth century (the Russian Revolution of 1905 or the later Russian pogroms).  • Jewish Emancipation. o Rise of political liberalism following the Enlightenment. o 1782: Joseph II placed Jews under same laws as Christians in Hapsburg Empire. o 1789: National Assembly in France recognizes Jews as French citizens. o Mixing of Jewish and Christian communities in Italy and Germany during the Napoleonic wars. o Post-1848: Germany, Italy, Low Countries, and Scandinavia all allow Jews to attain full citizenship. o 1858: Jews allowed to take seats in British Parliament. o 1867: Austria-Hungary extends full legal rights to Jews. o In Russia and Poland, “the traditional modes of prejudice and discrimination continued unabated until World War I” (Kagan, p. 780). This prompted many Jews to flee to seemingly freer Western European countries. o The elimination of social and political barriers led to the rise of Jews in a range of professions and financial industries. o This assimilation and economic success created a climate where it was possible for those who continued to view Jews as cultural outsiders to hold them accountable for the economic crises of the 1870s.  Students may note the example of the Rothschild family in both France and England; Lionel Rothschild (1808-79).  Students may also cite other examples of assimilated Jews including Felix Mendelssohn, Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud. o This tendency toward scapegoating contributed to a new wave of anti-Semitism.  • Anti-Semitism and the Russian Situation. o Discrimination and political disenfranchisement continued through the nineteenth century. o Outsider status and persistent discrimination, along with the tendency of authorities to blame Jews for the 1881 assassination of Tsar Alexander II and the Russian Revolution of 1905, led to pogroms in Kiev, Odessa, and Warsaw. These pogroms continued until 1917. This rise in popular anti-Semitism was generally ignored by the tsar, the police, and the state bureaucracy. o These large-scale attacks led to Jews fleeing from eastern to western countries. Question 6 Historical Background (continued)  • Jewish Migration from Russia and Eastern Europe to the West. o Two million Eastern European Jews migrated to Western Europe between 1868 and 1914. o 70,000 settled in Germany; vast majority moved to urban areas. o Migration of many rural Jews to urban areas also occurred at this time. o These migrations coincided with downturns in the economic cycle—“Jews became scapegoats for the high rates of unemployment and high prices that seemed to follow in their wake” (Kishlansky, p. 729). o This tendency was exacerbated by the fact that many of these migrants were peddlers, artisans, and small shopkeepers. o “Differing in language, culture, and dress, they were viewed as alien in every way” (Kishlansky, p. 729). o Many came to believe that Jewish “foreigners” were taking up too much space.  The increased presence of Jews led some intellectuals, such as Heinrich von Treitschke, to react unfavorably. Treitschke coined the phrase: “The Jews are our misfortune.”  • The Nation-State and Nationalism. o Emerging concern with creating citizens and forging a national community based on a common identity of citizens.  Examples include unified Germany under Bismarck (1871-90), the Third French Republic, unified Italy, and Great Britain.  There were some inclusive perspectives, but many definitions of the nation (and those who belonged to that nation) were predicated on notions of difference that could leave Jews vulnerable to exclusion. o Austria: success of bourgeois liberalism wanes by the latter decades of the nineteenth century.  New groups laying claim to power led to rise of socialism, intensely xenophobic nationalism, and mass politics.  Mass Parties including Christian Social Party (CSP) (founded 1893) embraced pan-Germanic, anticapitalist, and anti-Semitic ideas. The CSP’s ideas were taken up by students and artisans.  Karl Lueger (1844–1910), as leader of CSP, became mayor of Vienna in 1895. In the election campaign, he appealed to anti-Semitic tendencies and identified Jews with the excesses of capitalism.  These tendencies also merged in Vienna with concerns about the professional successes of Jews: “In the 1880s, more than half of Vienna’s physicians (61 percent in 1881) and lawyers (58 percent of barristers in 1888) were Jewish. Their professional success only heightened tensions and condemnations of Jews as an ‘alien race’” (Kishlansky, p.730). Question 6 Historical Background (continued)  o France: the best example of how these forces were at work is reflected in the Dreyfus Affair of 1894.  Alfred Dreyfus (1859–1935) was a Jewish army officer (from Alsace) accused of selling military secrets to Germans.  His trial became a lightning rod for xenophobia; hatred of foreigners and hatred of Jews emerged as central issues.  Dreyfus stripped of commission and honors, imprisoned on Devil’s Island.  Trial revisited on several occasions; Dreyfus finally exonerated in 1906.  The Dreyfus Affair resulted in sharp divisions between pro-Dreyfusards and anti-Dreyfusards.  Pro-Dreyfusards (tended to be on left, wanted to uphold justice and freedom). o Émile Zola. • Wrote “J’Accuse” (1898). o A spirited appeal for justice; accuses French military and judiciary of social evil.  Anti-Dreyfusards (tended to be on the right and were associated with traditional institutions like the Roman Catholic Church and the army; monarchist; saw themselves as defenders of France and were often openly anti-Semitic). o Included Édouard Adolphe Drumont (1844 –1917). • Anti-Semitic League (founded 1889). • La Libre Parole (anti-Semitic newspaper).  • Race and Social Darwinism. o Charles Darwin (1809-82).  Promotion of theory of natural selection in On the Origin of Species (1859).  Application of this theory to human beings in Descent of Man (1871).  o Application of Darwin’s ideas to evolutionary ethics by Herbert Spencer (1820–1903).  Belief in human society progressing through competition. o Emergence in late-nineteenth century of idea that race was the single dominant explanation of history and dominant factor in determining the character of large groups of people. o Emerging belief in scientifically demonstrated racial hierarchies.  Arthur Gobineau (1816-82). o Wrote Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races (1853-54).  Houston Stewart Chamberlain (1855–1927). o British, but worked in Germany. o Biological determinist. o Wrote Foundations of the Nineteenth Century (1899). • Argued that Jews were a major enemy of European racial regeneration. o Similar ideas in Germany found in work of Paul de Lagarde (1827-91) and Julius Langbehn (1851–1907). Question 6 Historical Background (continued)  • Rise of Zionism. o Some Jewish leaders in Central and Western Europe saw anti-Semitism as a problem with a political solution.  Reacting, particularly, to the Dreyfus case (1894) and to the Russian pogroms.  Became convinced that Europe was not safe for Jews. o Supporters of Zionism called for the creation of their own nation—a new Zion (the ancient biblical homeland).  Movement especially popular in Galicia (Poland), Russia, and the Hapsburg Empire o Theodor Herzl (1860–1904).  Austrian Jew born in Budapest.  Most important proponent of Zionism.  Witnessed anti-Semitism as journalist in France.  Wrote The Jewish State (1896). o Argued for a Jewish homeland in Palestine.  o This ultimately aroused Christian and Islamic opposition; even some Jews worried that Zionism would enable charges that Jews were bad citizens. o For some anti-Semites, the existence of a Zionist movement allowed for the further development of notions of Jewish difference.  Question 6 Historical Background (continued)  Timeline  Jewish Emancipation 1782: Jews placed under same laws as Christians in the Hapsburg Empire. 1789: National Assembly recognizes Jews as French citizens. 1858: Jews allowed to take seats in British Parliament. 1868: Austria–Hungary extends full legal rights to Jews.  Anti-Semitism and the Russian Situation 1881: Tsar Alexander II assassinated. 1905: Russian Revolution. 1881–1917: Periodic pogroms.  Jewish Migration from Russia and Eastern Europe to West1868–1914: Two million Eastern European Jews move to Western Europe. 1889: Heinrich von Treitschke writes Jews Among Us.  The Nation-State and Nationalism1871-90: Germany under Bismarck. 1889: Édouard Drumont creates the Anti-Semitic League in France. 1893: Christian Social Party founded in Austria. 1894: Dreyfus Affair (France). 1895: Karl Lueger elected Mayor of Vienna on an anti-Semitic platform. 1898: Émile Zola writes “J’Accuse.”  Race and Social Darwinism 1820–1903: Herbert Spencer. 1853-54: Arthur Gobineau publishes Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races. 1859: Charles Darwin publishes On the Origin of Species. 1871: Charles Darwin publishes Descent of Man. 1899: Houston Stewart Chamberlain publishes Foundations of the Nineteenth Century.  The Rise of Zionism1896: Theodor Herzl publishes The Jewish State.   Question 7   Analyze the ways in which the events of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic period (1789–1815) led people to challenge Enlightenment views of society, politics, and human nature.  9–8 Points • Thesis is explicit and fully responsive to the question (clearly provides brief introduction of Enlightenment thought and how events challenged the three Enlightenment views).  • Organization is clear with consistent and effective analysis in support of the argument (may analyze each event and how they challenged Enlightenment views or may address in separate paragraphs). • Essay provides a balance between BOTH analyzing the major events of the French Revolution and Napoleonic period that challenged the three Enlightenment views proposed before 1789 AND the response to those events at some length (response may also include the post-1815 period). • Analysis of how previous Enlightenment views were challenged by events that occurred between 1789 and 1815 are supported by multiple pieces of relevant evidence. • May contain errors that do not detract from the argument; even a “9” need not be flawless.  7–6 Points • Thesis is explicit and responsive to the question (provides brief introduction of Enlightenment thought and how events challenged the three Enlightenment views).   • Organization is clear with effective support of the argument but is not consistently followed.  • Essay provides a balance between BOTH analyzing the major events of the French Revolution and Napoleonic period that challenged the three Enlightenment views proposed before 1789 AND the response to those events at least briefly (response may also include the post-1815 period). • Analysis of how previous Enlightenment views were challenged by events that occurred between 1789–1815 are supported by at least one piece of relevant evidence. • Categories (Enlightenment views) may be conflated even at this level. • May contain an error that detracts from the argument.  5–4 Points • Thesis is explicit but not fully responsive to the question (may put more emphasis on Enlightenment thought or how events challenged Enlightenment views). • Organization is apparent and effective in support of the argument but not consistently followed.  • Essay shows some imbalance; mentions BOTH the events of the French Revolution and Napoleonic period that led to challenges to Enlightenment views proposed before 1789 AND the response to those events, but may discuss only one (may address only two of the Enlightenment views).  • Most of the discussion of how previous Enlightenment views were challenged by events that occurred between 1789–1815 is supported by at least one piece of relevant evidence. • May contain a few errors that detract from the argument.  3–2 Points • No explicit thesis or a thesis that merely repeats/paraphrases the prompt. • Organization is unclear and ineffective. • Essay shows serious imbalance and may completely ignore one of the question’s tasks (analyzing the ways the events challenged Enlightenment views OR the response). • Only one or two major assertions are supported by relevant evidence. • May contain several errors that detract from the argument. Question 7 (continued)  1–0 Points • No discernable attempt at a thesis. • No discernable organization; may attempt to answer the question but fails to do so.  • One or none of the major topics suggested by the prompt is mentioned (may suggest a challenge to Enlightenment thought but supports it with evidence that is out of the time period). • Little or no supporting evidence used. • May contain numerous errors that detract from the argument.                     AP® European History 2008 Scoring Guidelines                 The College Board: Connecting Students to College Success   The College Board is a not-for-profit membership association whose mission is to connect students to college success and opportunity.
