Provides an appropriate, explicitly stated thesis that directly addresses all parts of the question. Thesis must not simply restate the question. The thesis must address arguments and practices, though it does not necessarily need to use both the terms “arguments” and “practices” explicitly.  The thesis must suggest a minimal level of analysis drawn from the documents with some degree of specificity. The complete thesis must appear in either the introduction OR the conclusion. 2. Discusses a majority of the documents individually and specifically. The essay must discuss at least seven documents—even if these are used incorrectly—by reference to anything in the box. A document can be cited by number or by name, or it can be referenced in other ways that make it clear which document is being discussed. Documents cannot be referenced together to get credit for this point (e.g., “Documents 1, 4, and 6 suggest . . . ”) unless they are discussed individually. 3.Demonstrates understanding of the basic meaning of a majority of the documents (may misinterpret no more than one). The essay may not significantly misinterpret more than one document. A major misinterpretation is an incorrect analysis or one that leads to an inaccurate grouping or a false conclusion. An essay cannot earn this point if no credit was awarded for point 2 (discusses a majority of the documents). A document that is erroneously grouped with other documents is considered a misinterpretation. 4.Supports the thesis with appropriate interpretations of a majority of the documents. The essay must use at least seven documents correctly, and the documents used in the body of the essay must provide support for the thesis. An essay cannot earn this point if no credit was awarded for point 1 (appropriate thesis). An essay also cannot earn this point if no credit was awarded for point 2 (discusses a majority of the documents). 5. Analyzes point of view or bias in at least three documents. The essay must make a reasonable effort to explain why a particular source expresses the stated view by • relating authorial point of view to author’s place in society (motive, position, status, etc.); OR • evaluating the reliability of the source; OR • recognizing that different kinds of documents serve different purposes; OR • analyzing the tone of the documents; must be clear and relevant. Note: 1. Attribution alone is not sufficient to earn credit for point of view (POV). 2. It is possible for essays to discuss point of view collectively (includes two or three               documents in making a single POV analysis), but this counts for only one point of view. 6. Analyzes documents by explicitly organizing them in at least three appropriate groups. A group must contain at least two documents that are used correctly and individually. Groupings and corresponding documents may include the following (not an exhaustive list of possible acceptable groupings): For Toleration Moral principles/rights: 1, 5, 6, 10 Practical necessity: 2, 4, 5, 11 Peace and unity: 4, 5, 9, 11 Religious principles: 1, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11 Enlightened thinkers:  1, 6, 11       Against Toleration Raison d’etat/harmful to the state: 7, 8, 12 Religious convictions:  3, 7, 8 Middle Ground/Compromise Protestant and Catholic compromise: 2, 4, 5, 10 Catholic concessions: 4, 5 Protestant concessions: 1, 9 Rulers             For toleration: 2, 5, 10              Against toleration: 8, 12 Expanded Core: 0–3 points to a total of 9 points Expands beyond the basic core of 1–6. The basic score of 6 must be achieved before an essay can earn expanded core points. Credit awarded in the expanded core should be based on holistic assessment of the essay. Factors to consider in holistic assessment may include • Has a clear, analytical, and comprehensive thesis (that may explicitly discuss “arguments” and “practices” concerning religious toleration). • Uses all or almost all of the documents (10-12 documents). • Uses the documents persuasively as evidence (may group them explicitly into “arguments” and “practices” categories). • Shows understanding of nuances of the documents.  • Analyzes point of view or bias in at least four documents cited in the essay. • Analyzes the documents in additional ways (e.g., develops more groupings). • Recognizes and develops change over time. • Brings in relevant “outside” information. AP® EUROPEAN HISTORY 2013 SCORING GUIDELINES Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) A Closer Look at the Thesis Statement Examples of acceptable and unacceptable theses Strong theses • “Different people took different routes regarding their practices and arguments about religious toleration. Some political leaders supported religious toleration for political purposes, other rulers used it to maintain peace and stability, enlightened thinkers supported religious toleration based on principle, and some rulers did not support religious toleration out of religious conviction.” • “The Protestant Reformation of the 16th Century sparked a widespread debate over the topic of religious toleration. In some regions, non-Catholic religions were accepted in varying degrees, while in others Protestants were marked as heretics and persecuted. In some regions of Europe religious toleration was granted as a means of maintaining peace and unity. Conversely, other countries harshly persecuted non-conformers as a method of preserving the power of the absolute ruler.” Adequate theses • “Many Europeans struggled over the issue of religious toleration. The arguments and practices included toleration, non-toleration, and compromise. The debate came down to peace or not within the state.” • “From the sixteenth to eighteenth century, religious practices and arguments were subject to the ideals and motives of their particular regions. Monarchs in one part of Europe would allow a degree of tolerance according to their own desires, while popular movements would affect the policy of another region. Thus the religious practices and arguments of the time were largely influenced by political motives of maintenance of peace or of consolidation of power, as well as popular desires for religious liberty.” Inadequate theses • “There were lots of arguments and practices concerning religious toleration in Europe. These can be looked at in several distinct ways.” • “Religious toleration was very common in the sixteenth and eighteenth century. During the early modern times of Europe, almost every state had its church that had its own ruler. Because of the Protestant Reformation, most states of Europe had religious minorities.” A Closer Look at Misinterpretations Examples of major misinterpretations or incorrect usage coming from the documents • “Document three advocates tolerance. The Protestant council favors tolerance by lack of violence and persecution” (Doc. 3). • “Voltaire, a philosopher concerning many organized religions, also was against multiple coexisting religions.” Examples of minor errors • “King Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes and cast out those who wouldn’t convert to Catholicism. He also proclaimed that any caught preaching the Protestant faith would be executed” (Doc. 8). • The student mistakes “galleys” for “gallows.” • “Rousseau, a French philosophe argued for religious toleration under the government, but his view may have been affected by his overwhelming adoration of English society, which did practice religious toleration” (Doc. 11). Although the essay cites Rousseau, it clearly meant to refer to Voltaire. A Closer Look at Point of View There are many means by which an essay can demonstrate point-of-view analysis.  (The following examples are NOT meant to be exhaustive). Examples of ACCEPTABLE point-of-view analysis Relating authorial point of view to author’s place in society • “Castellio, as a French Protestant from a Catholic country (although writing in Switzerland), must have faced intolerance himself.” • “By banning Protestant faith across his nation, King Louis XIV attempted to secure his own kingdom and power from the threats of uprising.” Evaluating the reliability of the source • “Though the Catholic chapter agreed to fix certain concerns of the Protestants, the document is biased, as it portrays the Catholics as extremely understanding and open because it was a Catholic document and would aim to positively portray the clergy responsible for the changes, even though the toleration is by no means all-encompassing.” • “This source, as a private letter from a mother to her son and heir, would be likely to be an accurate expression of Maria Theresa’s personal sentiments.” Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Recognizing that different kinds of documents serve different purposes • “Also, because these Levelers were writing in a pamphlet, they likely used particularly strong language to get people to support them against a monarchy they felt was religiously oppressive.” • “They were against the King and the idea of a monarchy and supported Parliament in the English Civil War. By releasing their pamphlet they hoped to appeal to the crowds of England.” Analyzing the tone of the documents • “There might be irony in this document since Castellio is condemning other forms of Protestantism when he is a Protestant himself.” Examples of UNACCEPTABLE point-of-view analysis • “Document 1 is reliable because Sebastian Castellio is a theologian.” Why is this unacceptable? This is merely attribution with no attempt at further analysis beyond the stated information from the document itself; the statement does not explain why a theologian might be a reliable source (authorial POV and reliability). • “However, the municipal council may be making this exception for many reasons seeing how the document is a contract.” Why is this unacceptable? The statement does not explicitly analyze how a contract might cause a change in government policy (documents serving different purposes). • “The Edict of Fontainebleau is not biased because it is an edict.” Why is this unacceptable? This is merely attribution with no attempt at further analysis. The analysis is erroneous in implying that proclamations are purely objective (documents serving different purposes). Analyze the differences between the political ideals expressed in the visual arts of the Renaissance (15th – 16th centuries) and the political ideals expressed in the visual arts of the Neoclassical/Romantic period (18th – 19th centuries). 8-9 Points • Thesis explicitly and fully responds to the terms of the question. • Organization is clear and effectively supports the argument. • Body paragraphs develop political differences as seen in the art of both periods. • Essay is well-balanced. • Uses substantial specific evidence to illustrate political ideals-art nexus in both periods. • May contain errors or off-topic content that does not detract from the argument. • May describe nonpolitical aspects of the art periods. • May make art attribution errors within the period. 6-7 Points • Thesis is explicit and responds to the terms of the question. • Responds to both periods but not in a balanced manner. • Essay is organized and supports the argument but may stray off task. • Art-politics connection in both periods is covered if uneven. • Uses specific evidence to support the argument in both art periods but may be imbalanced. • May contain an error or off-topic content that detracts from the argument. • May make art attribution errors outside of the period. 4-5 Points • Thesis is explicit but may not be fully responsive to the question. • Essay may only make an art-politics connection with one of the art periods. • Uses some specific and appropriate evidence that accurately makes an art-politics connection. • May contain a few errors that detract from the argument. 2-3 Points • May contain no explicit, valid or accurate thesis or just paraphrases the question. • Essay may be poorly organized. • Essay fails to address the art-politics question in any substantial manner. • Uses little to no valid, appropriate evidence that supports the argument for an arts-politics connection. 0-1 Points • No discernible attempt at a thesis. • Disorganized response that suggests little or no understanding of the question; may ignore the charge of the question. • Uses no relevant evidence. • May contain numerous errors that detract from the argument. Historical  Background Possible approaches to this question include RENAISSANCE (Italian) 1.Focus on the city state; art used for its glorification Brunelleschi’s dome for Santa Maria del Fiore. Florence commissioned Michelangelo’s David, in part to celebrate the defense of civil liberties and as a metaphor of Florence’s victory over Milan. 2. Celebrating the power of aristocratic elites The Medici, Federigo da Montefeltro 3. Celebrating the power of the papacy—indivisibility of religious and political power St. Peter’s Basilica, Sistine Chapel ceiling 4. Role of civic humanism: obligation to support and advance the city-state, in this case by art and architecture Supportable by much of the above. RENAISSANCE (Northern) 1. Celebration of royal/imperial power              Portrait of Charles V by Titian, 1548 2. Celebration of the rising nation-state, new statecraft              The Ambassadors, Hans Holbein the Younger, 1533              Henry VIII, Hans Holbein, 1540 NEOCLASSICAL/ROMANTIC PERIOD Neoclassicism 1. Cultivating classical republican values of individual sacrifice for the good of society Jacques Louis David, Oath of the Horatii, 1784; David, The Lictors Bringing  Brutus the Bodies of His Sons, 1789; David, Oath of the Tennis Court, 1791; David, Death of Marat, 1793 Romanticism 1. Celebrating imperial, Napoleonic power; art as propaganda David,  Napoleon Crossing the Alps, 1800–1805; David, Napoleon’s Coronation, 1805–1807;   Napoleon Visiting the Plague-Stricken at Jaffa by Antoine-Jean Gros, 1804; Napoleon in His Study, David, 1812 2. Celebrating nationalism and liberalism Delacroix, Liberty Leading the People, 1830 3. Celebrating nationalism J.M.W. Turner, Battle of Trafalgar, 1822; Arc de Triomphe, 1806–1836; The Third of May, 1808, Francesco Goya 4.Critiques of royal authority Gericault, The Raft of the Medusa, 1819; Peterloo Massacre, drawing, 1819 Analyze the differences between the motives that shaped European colonial expansion in the period 1450 – 1750 and the motives that shaped European colonial expansion in the period 1850 – 1914. 9-8 Points • Thesis is explicit and addresses more than two motives for European expansion in both time periods. • Organization is clear, consistent, and the essay offers strong analysis of differences in motives. • Essay is well balanced and effectively analyzes motives and differences for both periods. • Analysis of motives is well supported by relevant evidence (i.e., specific countries, well developed ideas, or both). • May contain errors that do not detract from the argument; may also contain minimal extraneous information that does not detract from the argument. For example, “Cotton was produced in North America in the 1450 – 1750 period”; mentioning this is not erroneous. 7-6 Points • Thesis is explicit and addresses more than one motive. • Organization  is clear, consistent, and the essay offers analysis of differences in motives. • Essay is balanced; analyzes motives and differences for both periods. • Analysis of motives is supported by relevant evidence (i.e., specific countries, well developed ideas, or both). • May contain an error that detracts from the argument; may contain some extraneous information that  does not detract from the argument. 5-4 Points • Thesis is explicit but not fully responsive to the question. • Organization is clear and effective. Time periods may be treated in a more parallel fashion, with analytical connection between the two provided solely at the beginning or the end of the essay. • Essay shows some imbalance; may discuss one period in greater depth than the other. • Motives may be analyzed with general evidential support (i.e., “Europeans in Africa”). • May contain a few errors that detract from the argument; may contain extraneous information that does detract from the argument. For example, slavery did exist in Africa in the 1850 – 1914 period, but enslavement by Europeans should specify Leopold, Belgium, Congo Free State, or even Belgian Congo. 3-2 Points • No explicit thesis or a thesis that merely repeats or paraphrases the prompt. • Organization may be unclear and ineffective. • Essay shows serious imbalance, motives identified but discussed sparingly. • Motives may be mentioned but not explained. • May contain several errors that detract from the argument. 1-0 Points • No discernible attempt at a thesis. • No discernible organization. • Motives may not be mentioned or not be explained. • Little or no supporting evidence used. • May contain numerous errors that detract from the argument. Historical Background • Western Europeans seeking spices, slaves, and gold wanted to bypass Ottoman and Venetian “middlemen” controlling trade with the East. Portugal sought an overseas route to India. The Portuguese established settlements in Madeira and the Azores in the 1420s and from there launched trade with Africa. They settled at Arguin in the 1440s, and within 60 years Portugal controlled Europe’s trade in African gold. Prince Henry the Navigator’s school for sailing and navigation promoted voyages of exploration. Bartholomew Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1487, and in 1498 Vasco da Gama reached India, allowing Portuguese traders to establish settlements at Goa and Calcutta.  • Spain sent Columbus to find a water route to China in 1492, and he discovered the West Indies. Ferdinand Magellan and Amerigo Vespucci verified that Columbus had discovered a New World, which spurred desire to conquer and control that region. Hernan Cortes arrived in Mexico in 1519, and by 1521 he had defeated the Aztec Empire for Spain. In 1532, Francisco Pizarro attacked the Inca Empire. Settlements were established and gold, riches, and produce sent back to Spain. Adventure and opportunity attracted sailors and soldiers, while the practice of primogeniture left many second sons open to lives in the New World. • Catholic missionaries followed the conquistadors. The Jesuits and the Franciscans were active in the Caribbean and throughout South and Central America during the 16th and 17th centuries. Catholic agents established churches and missions in Portuguese settlements in Madeira, Goa, Japan, and China. Missionaries brought faith, European languages and cultural customs, and spread imperial influence. English Puritans settled in Plymouth in 1620. Dissenters from the Church of England established colonies and communities in North America: Puritan dissenters in Rhode Island (1636), the Quakers in Pennsylvania (1682), and English Catholics in Maryland (1634).  French Huguenots settled in New Amsterdam and New Rochelle following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. • Aside from gold and silver profits (especially from Potosi), mercantilists sought other raw materials. Sugar became a source of wealth, especially for England and France. Tens of millions of pounds of sugar were shipped from the Caribbean to other colonies in North America and also back to Europe. Production was enabled by the introduction of large-scale slave labor.  After indigenous populations were depleted by disease and violence, colonial planters turned to African slaves for labor. Slaves were exported to the sugar cane plantations and to southern colonies in North America, where they produced tobacco, rice, and, eventually, cotton. Triangular trade developed in response to these demands for colonial labor. • International competition became an important motive. The Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) divided unclaimed lands between Spain and Portugal. Facing the fact that Portugal had found a water route to India, Spain sent Magellan to find a passage to Asia in 1517. England was concerned about losing ground to competitor nations and chartered the East India Company (1600) to compete with the Dutch. British colonies in Virginia were established to promote England’s economic power: Roanoke (1585) to serve as a base for attacking Spanish treasure ships and Jamestown (1607) to find gold and a water passage to the Orient.  British desires to consolidate holdings along the Eastern Seaboard required French and Dutch holdings to be controlled or conquered. New Amsterdam was conquered in 1664 and its ownership finalized in 1674. British and French rivalry over key areas in North America, the Saint Lawrence and Ohio River valleys and northern New England, continued until the end of the Seven Years’ War (1763). The same was true  in India, where both increasingly allowed the Compagnie des Indes and the British East India Company to assume government functions. The War of Jenkins’ Ear (1739–1743) was fought intermittently over British goods being shipped to Spanish holdings in the Caribbean. • The New Imperialism was characterized by European assumption of direct control over indigenous peoples rather than indirect control over emigrant settlers. The differences in religion, technology, and cultural practices were often exacerbated by European ideas about racial superiority, cultural superiority, and social Darwinism. Many European powers assumed a civilizing mission, illustrated in Rudyard Kipling’s poem, “The White Man’s Burden” (1899). • Imperialism of free trade, or the right of a European country to sell its goods without tariffs or restrictions from the target market, emerged. The Opium Wars with China and the Treaty of Nanking in 1842 granted the British control of Hong Kong, rights of extraterritoriality, and access for British missionaries. After 1860, Britain and France forced China to open more ports and to accept additional foreign influences. At the same time, European governments used tariffs and restrictions to protect their home markets. These stifled competition from India and other Asian markets. In India, British protectionist measures reduced Indian cotton exports from finished products to raw materials, which were then finished in Britain and sold back to Indians. • Investments in infrastructure were made to ensure easier passage to areas under European control, which also motivated Europeans to acquire more territory. The Suez Canal (1869) was built by the French, but a controlling interest was purchased by the British in 1875 to protect their holdings in India. The Panama Canal was begun in 1881 by the French, although they were forced to sell their interests. Cecil Rhodes envisioned a grand African railway in the 1880s and 1890s connecting South Africa to the Nile, a “Cape to Cairo” connection. Germany financed the construction of a Baghdad Railway in the early 1900s connecting the Mediterranean (and ultimately Berlin) to the Persian Gulf. • Concerned about the balance of power following defeats in the Napoleonic Wars, France invaded Algeria in 1830 and acquired control of Ivory Coast in 1843. After the loss of Alsace-Lorraine in the Franco-Prussian War, France expanded its overseas empire in 1875 by acquiring the French Congo, establishing a protectorate in Tunisia (1881), and acquiring French Sudan (1883). Rules for establishing European territorial claims in Africa were formalized at the Berlin Conference (1884– 1885). The French went on to acquire Niger (1890), Guinea (1891), and Chad (1900). Their drive eastward and the British drive southward down the Nile culminated in a standoff at Fashoda (in modern-day Sudan) in 1898. France eventually yielded all claims to the Nile River basin, leaving the area in British control. • Britain’s involvement was largely to protect India and its own economy. The British government assumed control of India following the Sepoy Rebellion in 1857. Queen Victoria was named Empress of India in 1877. Control over the Suez Canal came about in 1875, and concerns over the Nile and its source (discovered in Sudan in 1862) led the British to conquer Sudan in 1899. Britain also had colonies in East Africa, Uganda, and Somalia. British presence in South Africa originated in the early 19th century, but under the influence of Cecil Rhodes British interests expanded north. The discovery of diamonds and gold in the region increased the British presence, causing conflicts with the Boers living in the adjoining Transvaal Republik and eventually leading to the Boer War in 1899. • Leopold II of Belgium sought African possessions to bolster his country’s economy and international prestige. Leopold sent explorer David Livingston into the Congo region in the 1870s; later he lobbied for control of the Congo River basin and was granted recognition of his control of Congo Free State. Leopold’s control over the Congolese people was brutal and harsh. He amassed a tremendous fortune in rubber and ivory. • German popular pressure to expand in Africa conflicted with Bismarck’s reluctance to do so, but Germany did establish protectorates in Cameroon, Southwest Africa, and East Africa in 1884 and 1885. Italy established Assab in Eritrea, resulting in the 1894 Abyssinian War, an Italian loss both in terms of money and prestige. Italy also acquired control of Italian Somaliland. Analyze the differences between the impact of Newtonian physics on European culture and the impact of Darwinian biology on European culture. 9-8 Points • Thesis explicitly explains in what ways Newtonian physics and Darwinian biology each impacted European culture. • Organization is clear, consistently followed, and effective in discussing at least two differing impacts of Newtonian physics and Darwinian biology on European culture — either discussed together or separately. • Essay is well balanced, discussing both Newton and Darwin, though essay may offer less discussion of one or the other. • Essay provides relevant evidence of two or more impacts on European culture — at least one per scientist. • May contain errors in fact or chronology that do not detract from the argument. 7-6 Points • Thesis explains in what ways Newtonian physics and Darwinian biology each impacted European culture. • Organization is clear and effective but may be less consistent by providing one developed and one less-developed argument of Newton’s and Darwin’s differing impacts on European culture. • Essay is relatively balanced, discussing both Newton and Darwin, though discussion of one or the other may be clearly less developed. • Essay provides evidence of at least two impacts on European culture — one per scientist. • May contain an error in fact or chronology that detracts from the argument. 5-4 Points • Thesis attempts to answer the prompt but may be general, singular, or vague in explaining ways that Newtonian physics and Darwinian biology impacted European culture.  • Organization is clear and effective but may be less consistent by providing one developed or several less-developed arguments about Newton’s and Darwin’s differing impact on European culture. • Essay may show imbalance, offering only one valid discussion of Newton or Darwin. • Essay provides evidence of one or two impacts on European culture. • May contain a few errors in fact or chronology that detract from the argument. 3-2 Points • Thesis may restate prompt or offer little or no valid explanation of ways Newtonian physics and Darwinian biology impacted European culture. • Organization offers minimal argumentation of Newton’s or Darwin’s differing impact on European culture, or either. • Essay may show serious imbalance; parts of the prompt are neglected or misconstrued. • Essay may offer some evidence of cultural impact, but it may be vague or conflated. • May contain several errors in fact or chronology that detract from the argument. 1-0 Points • No discernible attempt at a thesis. • Organization may be coincidental, with no argument of Newton’s or Darwin’s differing impact on European culture. • Essay may show gross imbalance; parts of the prompt are ignored. • Essay may offer little, ineffectual, or irrelevant evidence of cultural impact. • May contain numerous errors in fact or chronology that detract from the argument. The Question • Students must explain HOW Newtonian physics and Darwinian biology each impacted culture differently. • There is no specific time frame specified. • The prompt requires students to discuss two or more examples of impact. . Clarification • The phrasing invites students to write separate arguments on Newton’s and Darwin’s impact on culture, with explicit or implicit discussion of differences.  • The prompt does not require students to explain Newtonian physics or Darwinian biology. • European Culture may be interpreted as European society. Thus, essays could discuss persons (e.g., Voltaire, Spencer, philosophes), institutions (church, government), eras (Scientific Revolution, Enlightenment), intellectual movements ( Social Darwinism, Deism) and political trends (imperialism, laissez faire liberalism). • Essays could discuss contemporaneous time periods, bordering time periods, or both. References to chronologically or thematically more distant developments may be valid but should be looked at carefully on a case-by-case basis (e.g., Industrial Revolution, Nazism). The Essay • Thesis. Essay must identify ways Newtonian physics and Darwinian biology each affected European culture, that is, how the culture was affected. • Organization. Essay must offer causal linkage between Newtonian physics and Darwinian biology on the one hand and European culture on the other. Discussion of two such linkages satisfies the prompt. • Balance. Essay must discuss the impact of each scientific advance on European culture. • Evidence. Essay must support at least one (combined or separate) societal impact per scientific advance. Clarifications • Strong essays will have explicit theses that deal with differing impacts for both scientific advances. Medium essays may only allude to impacts. • Strong essays will explicitly state the causal effects of each scientist on European culture. Medium essays may describe this in more general or partial terms. Weak essays often fail to address culture specifically. • Strong essays display sophistication in contrasting multiple developed examples of differing impact. Medium essays often discuss two to three examples in more basic terms. Weak essays tend to highlight one scientist over the other or discuss science rather than culture. • Strong essays will often distinguish themselves through well-chosen multiple evidence. Medium essays can also display mastery of fact but will typically have less material dealing with causality. Weak essays typically offer only generalizations as evidence. • Students must respond to the prompt in the thesis and the body (i.e., HOW these two scientific advances affected culture). Theses that repeat the prompt, elaborate on scientific innovation rather than societal impact, or have no linkage despite rich narratives in the body score low. • Discussion of incorrect information as part of an attempt to develop the argument constitutes an error that detracts from the essay’s argument. Extraneous information not contributing to the argument may be ignored. Occasional minor misstatements should not be counted as errors that detract from the argument. NEWTONIAN PHYSICS With his magnum opus Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, first published  in 1687), natural philosopher Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727) posited universal mathematical principles, formulas, and laws that could explain the motions of terrestrial and celestial objects. Synthesizing the work of Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo, Newtonian physics dethroned Aristotelian/Ptolemaic cosmology and enhanced the prestige of the scientific method as the means to the truth. The appeal of natural universal law regulating the material world profoundly impacted European culture: • Scientific Academies promoted mechanical learning (engineering) for the benefit of state power and emerging industry; Newtonian physics arguably helped lay the foundations of the Industrial Revolution. • The philosophes and salons of the Enlightenment and later figures spread Newton’s work to the literate, whose quest for rationality and self-governance sought to apply the concept of uniform, universal laws to human society as well as the natural world; social criticism resulted in both the defense of the free economic forces (Smith) and insistence on natural rights by contract or revolution (Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Hegel, Marx). • Deists argued that Newton’s mechanistic cosmology with its universal laws and predictable outcomes was evidence that God had created and set in motion the universe, but then no longer intervened in its working. (As a devout Christian, Newton himself saw no conflict between science and religion and insisted on God’s continued intervention in the physical world.) DARWINIAN BIOLOGY With his groundbreaking study On the Origins of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life (1859) and subsequent study The Descent of Man, and the Selection in Relation to Sex (1871), naturalist Charles Darwin (1809–1882) offered empirical evidence for the development of animal and plant life and the emergence of new species over time. He also introduced the principle of natural selection and the struggle for individuals and species to survive. Darwin’s methodology established general principles that have shaped most aspects of the biological sciences since his time. His theory of evolution radically altered conceptions of geologic time and human origins, and, for many, undermined conceptions of man’s dominant place in the universe. The Darwinian challenge to religious faith, hierarchal order, and human behavior had a profound impact on European culture: • Evolution undermined many people’s belief in the Bible’s account of the creation of the natural world as it offered an alternative explanation of the development of life without ongoing divine intervention. The adoption of a Darwinian outlook in the biological sciences ultimately led to the end of the (direct) role of religion in questions of science. • For some, Darwinism led to a questioning of the traditional and Christian notions of the centrality of man in the universe. Some interpretations of the theory of evolution relegated humans to a relatively recent species in the history of the natural world. • Adherents of Social Darwinism applied the concepts of natural selection to the social order and contemporary human and international relations. Herbert Spencer (1820–1903) coined the notion of the “survival of the fittest” (often misattributed to Darwin) and used it to justify laissez faire economic practices, as well as to promote the notion that certain “races” (usually Europeans) were biologically superior. The misapplication of Darwinian biology led to the justification of European imperialism and nationalistic and militaristic expansion. Analyze the factors that led to the expansion of women’s participation in the paid workforce in Europe over the course of the 20th century. 9-8 Points • Thesis is explicit and fully responsive to the question, explicitly linking factors to paid workforce outcomes for women over the “course of the 20th century.” • Organization is clear, consistently followed, and effective in support of the argument, focused on factors that affected participation in the paid workforce, not merely events that affected women. • Essay is well balanced. The essay task is plural (factors) and requires balanced coverage that spans the century. • All major assertions in the essay are supported by multiple pieces of specific evidence that link factor and outcome. • May contain errors that do not detract from the argument. 7-6 Points • Thesis explicitly links factors to paid workforce outcomes for women and is responsive to the “course of the 20th century.” • Organization is clear and effective in linking factors to participation in the workforce but not consistently followed. • Essay is balanced; the essay tasks (factors) cover the entire century, but there may be less coverage of early or late century or conflation or generalization of events and outcomes. • All major assertions in the essay are supported by specific evidence, and assertions attempt to link factor and outcome. • May contain an error that detracts from the argument. 5-4 Points • Thesis is explicit but not fully responsive; there may be little distinction between factors and actual outcomes, or thesis may not respond to the course of the century or rely on out-of- period evidence. • Organization is clear and effective in support of the argument but not consistently followed. Essay may generalize or err in linking some developments and outcomes. • Essay may show imbalance; some major topics suggested by the prompt may be neglected or links between factors and outcomes may be insufficient. • Most of the major assertions in the essay are supported by relevant evidence. • May contain a few errors that detract from the argument. 3-2 Points • Thesis is not explicit or incomplete, or the thesis merely repeats or paraphrases the prompt. • Organization is unclear and ineffective in treatment of factors or outcomes. • Essay shows serious imbalance, some major topics (factors, outcomes, post-World War II era) are neglected or are addressed superficially. • Major assertions are insufficiently supported by relevant evidence. • May contain several errors that detract from the argument. Question 5 (continued) 1-0 Points • No discernible thesis. • No effective organization. • One or none of the major topics suggested by the prompt is mentioned. • Little or no supporting evidence used. Historical Background • Analysis is demonstrated through causal links between factors and outcomes. The prompt asks the student to “analyze the factors,” in other words to link causal factors between various events, processes, and changes and the increasing participation of women in the paid workforce. Essays might describe details of the increase in women’s paid work outside the home, but they should primarily address the causes for that change. • The prompt is intentionally broad in scope, especially in its chronology; therefore examples are plentiful and can be drawn from throughout the century. The chronological and geographic scope are deliberately broad to afford students maximal opportunities for illustrative examples, but even high-level responses should not be required to cover every country or economic change. The prompt wording “the course of the 20th century” reasonably suggests an approach using chronological organization, which may include early century status quo, WWI expansion, WWII expansion and post-WWII economic, social, and cultural causes for expansion. • Some 19th century developments such as industrialization and urbanization continue into the time period and may be linked to 20th century outcomes to women’s participation in the paid workforce. • Appropriate factors most often cited in textbooks include Industrialization • Various phases. • National circumstances:western European, fascist states, communist states. Urbanization • Greater opportunity for employment in cities. • Higher cost of living influences female employment. Technological changes • Strength decreased as a factor for employment. • Labor-saving devices. • Jobs “suitable” for women from new technology: telephone, telegraph, office work. Economic changes • Increasing consumerism/materialism. • Increase in service jobs created opportunities. • Declining income from agriculture. • Wages for skilled work. • Consumerism necessitated additional income and created service jobs in department stores. • Consumerism:materialism created demand for “things.” • Craftsmen continued to work at home; wives and daughters went to the factories for work. • Urban or rural piecework of low-cost consumer goods (toys, clothing) widely used throughout Europe, providing additional work and income. Ideological/cultural/social changes • Taking on men’s work during the wars lessened gender distinctions. • Communist/ socialist rejection of bourgeois social organization encouraged women in the workforce. • Acceptance of independent (“modern”) women. • Late century challenges to parental, marriage, and gender roles. • “Modern woman:” acceptance of greater individual agency and choice. • Examples of prominent, “self-made” women: Florence Nightingale, Marie Curie, Mary Cassatt, Edith Cavell, Simone de Beauvoir, Valentina Tereshkova, Margaret Thatcher. • Cultural examples: Doll’s House. • Employer change of view towards women’s abilities. • Compulsory education factors: o end of child labor contribution to family income puts pressure on women to make up the difference o provided largely untapped pool of educated workers. Political/ government policy changes • Suffrage. • Imperialism introduced new products and consumer desire. • Education. • War-time contributions acknowledged. • Equality. • Post-WWII social legislation eased working outside the home. • Laws prohibiting child labor. • State-supported child care andmaternity leave. Health and medical • Birth control • Abortion • Fewer children • Later pregnancies • Greater longevity: need for income • Chronology 1903 Emmeline Pankhurst founds Women’s Social and Political Union. 1907 Maria Montessori opens Casa dei Bambini, a model for early childhood education outside the home. WWI era trends: Jobs opened to women: war work, civil service; women who entered wartime workforce often left the workforce after the war; influence of propaganda. 1918 German women gain the vote.

The process of increase of the “extent, number, volume, or scope of.” • Welfare State. “The tendency of post-World War II states to establish safety nets for citizens in areas of birth, sickness, old age, and unemployment.” “A system (developed on both sides during the Cold War) comprising state sponsored social programs to provide health care, family allowances, disability insurance, and pensions for veterans and retired workers.” Historical Background 1. Factors identified by textbooks as causes for the creation of the welfare state A. Response to economic hardship caused by the Great Depression and the two world wars. B. Cold War – concerns over the strength of Communist parties in Western Europe (France, Italy) are usually mentioned. C. Need for the reintegration of soldiers into civilian life. D. Anxiety over declining birth rates. E. Concern over wartime suffering (World War II). F. Socialist demands for social justice and liberty. G. Reduction of class tensions. H. Economic security designed to create citizens who could enjoy a more comfortable life. 2. Context A. By the early 20th century, a number of Western European governments had adopted measures that foreshadowed the welfare state of the mid-20th century. B. Bismarck’s Germany pioneered social welfare legislation in the 1880s (sickness and accident insurance, old-age pensions) as a way of weakening the Social Democratic Party. Despite Bismarck’s efforts, the Social Democratic Party retained the support of Germany’s workers and was the largest political party in the Reichstag by 1914. C. The British Liberal Party abandoned some of its commitment to laissez-faire in the years 1906–1916 when it enacted a host of social measures. One textbook describes the legislation as the “first hesitant steps toward the future British welfare state.” The reforms, according to some authors, were designed to halt the growth of the Labor Party. These reforms included insurance for sickness, accidents, old age, and (to a limited degree) unemployment. Some textbooks identify one piece of legislation by name (National Insurance Act of 1911). 3. The Great Depression (1930s). In the long run, the effects of the economic collapse (the rise of Nazism, the appeal of Communism) persuaded many in Western Europe of the need to provide citizens with some degree of economic security. A. Some textbooks note the fact that Great Britain cut benefits for the unemployed and the elderly in the early 1930s. B. In the 1930s, the British economist John Maynard Keynes called for increased state spending (“priming the pump”) when the private sector is unable or unwilling to maintain adequate levels of investment; deficit spending (“Keynesian economics”) will be accepted as orthodox economic policy by most Western states until the 1970s. C. France and the Popular Front – Leon Blum and the Socialist Party came to power in 1936 and introduced a series of reforms designed to meet the grievances of workers: the 40-hour work week, collective bargaining, and paid vacations. D. Scandinavian countries – Sweden, in particular, accepted a growing role for the state in the area of social welfare. Deficit spending financed old-age pensions, unemployment insurance, subsidized housing, and maternity allowances. One textbook asserts that Scandinavian socialism evolved from a long-standing tradition of cooperation. E. Some textbooks also point out that Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany provided public works programs, leisure time activities, inexpensive vacations, and subsidies for newlywed Aryan families. 4. The Postwar Period (after 1945). A new commitment surfaced to state-financed social programs. All textbooks focus on the example of Great Britain under the Labor government of Clement Attlee (1945–1951), and some mention specific legislation by name. Other Western European states receive less detailed treatment. Aims and motives are defined in a variety of ways. A. The Beveridge Report of 1942, which laid out the rationale for the British welfare state, is not explicitly mentioned by all authors. The report recommended the creation of a “cradle to the grave” welfare system involving unemployment and old-age insurance, as well as national health services. Conservatives in Great Britain modified the program in the 1950s and 1960s but did not challenge the idea of the welfare state until the 1970s. B. The Labour government (1945–1951) came to power pledging to implement a program of social welfare. Parliament passed legislation that established a comprehensive program of nationalized health insurance and service and comprehensive social security and unemployment insurance. The observation that such laws represented a broadening or extension of existing welfare legislation is made by some authors. Conservative governments in the 1950s supported efforts to improve housing. C. Other Western European states enacted social welfare legislation as well. Textbooks treat such programs in a more generalized way, citing prenatal policies designed to raise birthrates, subsidized housing, and free or inexpensive higher education as significant elements of the postwar welfare state. Some authors emphasize that in its initial stages, the welfare state often discouraged women’s participation in the workplace (in Great Britain and West Germany). Health care was widely adopted, although no uniform system existed. In some cases medical care was free, while in other countries citizens contributed a portion of the cost. Free tuition or low fees for university education was intended to reduce class tension. The welfare state resulted in a dramatic increase in state spending on welfare programs, usually paid for by higher taxes. D. Some textbooks also place the development of the welfare state in Western Europe within a broader context, pointing out that the Cold War created competition between two different systems of economic and social development. Analyze the factors that led to the rise of right-wing authoritarian regimes in continental Europe in the interwar period (1919–1939). 9-8 Points • Thesis is explicit and fully responsive to the question. • Organization is clear, consistently followed and effective, addressing multiple factors clearly linked to rise of regimes. • Essay is well balanced; all major topics suggested by the prompt are covered, although essay may contain more specific evidence from one regime than another or may treat right-wing regimes as a category with strong emphasis on developing the factors and links. • All major assertions in the essay are supported by multiple pieces of relevant evidence. • May contain errors that do not detract from the argument; identifying the USSR as a right-wing regime detracts from the argument, for example. 7-6 Points • Thesis is explicit and responsive to the question. • Organization is clear and effective; it must clearly link factors to the rise of regimes. • Essay is balanced; essay may address one regime significantly less than another if factors and linkage to rise of regimes are well balanced. • All major assertions in the essay are supported by at least one piece of relevant evidence. • May contain an error that detracts from the argument; identifying the USSR as a right-wing regime can be ignored if this is the only major error. 5-4 Points • Thesis is explicit, but not fully responsive to the question, or it is weakly developed. • Organization is clear and effective; may focus more on causes or responses and may have somewhat rudimentary analysis. • Essay shows some imbalance: o Strong discussion of only one regime that clearly links factors to rise of regime o More focus on conditions or regime building o Emphasizes time period after rise to power more than rise to power. • Most of the major assertions in the essay are supported by least one piece of relevant evidence; essay needs to do more than assert that conditions after WWI were poor. • May contain a few errors that detract from the argument. 3-2 Points • No explicit thesis or has a thesis that merely repeats or paraphrases the prompt or is poorly developed. • Organization is unclear and ineffective. • Essay shows serious imbalance; may have some information on one regime, information may be very generic, or essay may not support the thesis. • Only one or two major assertions are supported by relevant evidence; these essays are less specific and may describe generally poor conditions. • May contain several errors that detract from the argument. Question 7 (continued) 1-0 Points • No discernible attempt at a thesis or has a thesis that is wholly undeveloped. • No discernible organization. • Only one or none of the major topics suggested is mentioned or topics are undeveloped. • Little or no relevant supporting evidence used. Historical Background Italy • Political Factors: postwar democratic government could not find consensus between Socialist and Catholic parties and was not effective in dealing with issues such as: Treaty of Versailles (Italia irredenta, Fiume 1919), inflation, unemployment, Red Years 1920–1922 (progressive tax, legalized peasant land seizures). • Social and economic factors: demobilized soldiers increase unemployment; high inflation; agricultural depression (rural workers form Red Leagues); banditry in south; Socialists gain influence; workers/unions become more militant; fears of USSR; industrialists and landowners worried; fascist groups create disruption through riots and violence. • Rise of Mussolini: promises strong, militarized state to restore Italy to Roman glory; appeals to middle class and landowners; funded by wealthy industrialists and landowners; use of violence and terror against political left and to create disruption; use of propaganda; 1922 march on Rome, King Victor Emmanuel III asks Mussolini to form government, legislature grants Mussolini permission to rule by decree, Fascists become majority party in 1923 elections. Germany • Political Factors: Weimar Republic (parliamentary system, blamed for surrender and Versailles, Socialists and Communists gaining seats but at odds with each other); fear of revolution (growing Socialist/Communist influence contributes to growing militancy of right-wing groups like Freikorps); Spartacist revolt in 1919 crushed by Freikorps. • Social and economic factors: disappointment with Versailles (Clause 231 on war guilt, reparations, loss of natural resources, military limitations); inflation (reparations, burning/playing with worthless money, wheelbarrows of money, Germany defaults and France occupies Ruhr Valley 1923, Dawes Plan 1924); growing conviction that Jews and Socialists “stabbed Germany in the back” and stole the German victory; Great Depression (6 million unemployed by 1932, 44 percent drop in production, loss of welfare benefits). • Rise of Nazi party: helped by depression; scapegoats (primarily Communists, Socialists and Jews); racial nationalism; Hitler (leader by 1921, Beer Hall Putsch 1923, Mein Kampf 1925); appeals to middle class, small property owners, pensioners, elderly, war widows, rural middle class, workers in small businesses; second largest party in Reichstag in 1930; 1933, Hitler becomes Chancellor, Reichstag fire, proclaims Third Reich, Enabling Act. Spain • Political Factors: weak monarchy hurt by regionalism; political power dominated by coalitions of nobility, church and army; loses Morocco; falls to Second Republic in 1931; leftist “October Revolution” in 1934 lasted two weeks before Franco crushed it; Popular Front (Radicals, Communists, Socialists, some anarchists) v. conservative groups (old elites, church, monarchists, nationalists, most of army); country polarized between left and right until Civil War in 1936 (Hitler and Mussolini support Franco, USSR helps Republicans, West stays out, Republicans split, conservatives include most of army and are increasingly unified around Franco). • Social and economic factors: labor, peasantry, nobles, church, small middle class all at odds with each other; strikes; violence (Falange or Black Shirts 1933); weak economy (lack of infrastructure, regional differences, attempts to modernize, land reform, labor reform all fail). • Rise of Franco: supported by army and church; aid from Italy and Germany; brutal warfare. Eastern Europe • Political Factors: new democracies very fragile, little or no experience ruling themselves (multiple parties span political spectrum, rise of radical agrarian parties, legacies from different empires, clash of old and new elites); peace treaties (all countries felt their territorial claims had been violated, large populations of national minorities); had to build administration and rebuild from war; fears of communism. • Social and economic factors: high illiteracy rates; small middle class; agriculture depressed by grain imports; economies hampered by national tariffs that impeded prewar flow of goods; only Austria and Czechoslovakia had advanced industries; lack of infrastructure; growing/displaced populations; economic and social conflicts reinforced by ethnic and religious differences. • By 1939, right-wing authoritarian regimes in Poland (1926), Lithuania (1926), Albania (1928), Yugoslavia (1929), Hungary (1932), Austria (1933), Estonia (1934), Latvia (1934), Bulgaria (1935), Greece (1936), and Romania (1938). General Issues • Political Factors: fear of communism; old elites lost power and prestige after World War I; contested boundaries in many areas led to nationalism competing with new democracies; mass mobilization techniques used by parties; revolutionary new political movements on right and left; parliamentary governments seem unable to deal with crises so dictator looks more attractive; nationalism growing. • Social and economic factors: changed economic conditions as result of war and depression (war debt, inflation, increased government regulation of economy, beginnings of welfare states, rise of corporatism, increasingly militant working class); cultural change causes uncertainty, right-wing promises return to roots; middle class loses savings and security in economic crises and fear the left. • Fascist ideology o Mass mobilization but not political participation; hierarchical structure; rejection of parliamentary rule o Borrowed from other ideologies: conservative values of hierarchy and order and contempt for parliamentary ineffectiveness; popular racist doctrines; corporatism (unity over class warfare); Christian images of blood and martyrdom o New social and political order based on the nation; national identity overrides all others (rejection of class distinction); usually expansionist (not Spain or Portugal) • Fascism’s Appeal: o Spoke to many groups: World War I vets renew “camaraderie of the trenches” and patriotism; rural society threatened by urbanization; small businesses threatened by large corporations; businessmen threatened by workers; middle class threatened by socialism; old elites threatened by democracy; unemployed threatened by depression; religious way of life threatened by secularism; all fear communism. o Notion of service to the nation attractive; emphasizes unity over individualism; uniforms (shirts of one color that anyone can afford); paramilitary organization; decisive action to remake society through discipline and force; street drama, symbols, propaganda; violence; technology and modernization; seen as outside of corrupting politics of democracy; patriotism of World War I; holds “enemies” responsible for poor economy and bad governments (liberal politicians, Jews, Marxists, foreigners); fascism promises orderly, united and prosperous state.
