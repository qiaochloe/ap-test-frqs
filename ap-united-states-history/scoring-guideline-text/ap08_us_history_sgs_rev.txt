Kennedy, 1968  For years we have been told that the measure of our success and progress in Vietnam was increasing security and control for the population. Now we have seen that none of the population is secure and no area is under such control. . . .  This has not happened because our men are not brave or effective, because they are. It is because we have not conceived our mission in this war. It is because we have misconceived the nature of the war. It is because we have sought to resolve by military might a conflict whose issue depends upon the will and conviction of the South Vietnamese people. It is like sending a lion to halt an epidemic of jungle rot.  Document Information: • None of the Vietnamese population is secure. • United States soldiers have been brave and effective. • The United States misconceived its mission and the nature of the war. • Success depends on the will and conviction of the South Vietnamese people.  Document Inferences: • The United States population has been misled concerning the success and progress of the war. • The Tet Offensive undermined public support for the war. • The South Vietnamese people must take a greater role in fighting the war. • United States military power cannot resolve the issue of the control of Vietnam. • The Tet Offensive caused Johnson to withdraw from the 1968 presidential race.  Potential Outside Information Triggered by Document:Agent Orange American Independent Party Calley, William Chicago Seven Credibility gap Democratic National Convention, 1968 “Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?” Hoffman, Abbie Humphrey, Hubert Kennedy, Robert, assassination “Law and order” King, Martin Luther, assassination McCarthy, Eugene McNamara, Robert My Lai Massacre Napalm National Liberation Front New Hampshire primary Nixon Doctrine (Guam Doctrine) “Police riot” Political realignment, 1968 Rubin, Jerry Rusk, Dean Tet Offensive “The whole world is watching” Viet Cong Vietnamization Wallace, George   Question 1 Document Information and Inferences (continued)  DOCUMENT F  Source: James Fallows, writing about his 1969 draft board experience  . . . Even as the last of the Cambridge contingent was throwing its urine and deliberately failing its color-blindness tests, buses from the next board began to arrive. These bore the boys from Chelsea, thick, dark-haired young men, the white proles [members of the working class] of Boston. Most of them were younger than us, since they had just left high school, and it had clearly never occurred to them that there might be a way around the draft. They walked through the examination lines like so many cattle off to slaughter. I tried to avoid noticing, but the results were inescapable. While perhaps four out of five of my friends from Harvard were being deferred, just the opposite was happening to the Chelsea boys.  Document Information: • The Cambridge contingent threw urine and failed color-blindness tests. • Boys from Chelsea were dark-haired and younger than the boys from Cambridge. • Chelsea was a working-class neighborhood. • Chelsea boys did not know there was a way around the draft. • Fallows estimates that four out of five of his friends from Harvard were deferred whereas four out of five Chelsea boys were accepted.  Document Inferences: • Cambridge students knew how to avoid the draft. • Some college boys looked down on uneducated, working-class people while others felt guilty about their inability to avoid the draft. • A disproportionate number of those who did not attend college got drafted. • The draft heightened tensions between college and noncollege youth.  Potential Outside Information Triggered by Document:Blue collar workers Draft card burning Draft dodger Draft lottery Draftees Generation gap Selective Service System “Teach-ins”  Question 1 Document Information and Inferences (continued)  DOCUMENT G  Source: Richard Nixon, Address to the Nation, 1969  I know it may not be fashionable to speak of patriotism or national destiny these days.  But I feel it is appropriate to do so on this occasion. . . .   Let historians not record that when America was the most powerful nation in the world we passed on the other side of the road and allowed the last hopes for peace and freedom of millions of people to be suffocated by the forces of totalitarianism. And so tonight to you, the great silent majority of my fellow Americans, I ask for your support. . . .   Let us be united for peace. Let us also be united against defeat.

I propose that we conserve our limited resources:   – By no longer underwriting the appalling waste of money and manpower that has become such a bad habit in our military establishment; – By rejecting the purchase of weapons which are designed to fight the last war better, with almost no relevance to today’s threat; – By refusing to maintain extra military forces that can have no other purpose than to repeat our experience in Vietnam, a venture which nearly all of us now recognize as a monstrous national blunder;  – By repudiating the false world of old discredited myths, made up of blocs, puppets, and dominoes, facing instead the real world of today and the future with multiple ideologies and interests.  Document Information: • The United States should spend what is necessary for prudent defense. • The United States should conserve limited resources. • The military should stop wasting money and manpower. • The United States should refuse to maintain extra military forces. • The Vietnam War is a national blunder.  Document Inferences: • The United States was spending too much money on national defense. • The United States military was inefficient. • The United States needed to modernize its weapons systems. • The United States military was too large. • The domino theory, containment, and the Cold War are outdated concepts.  Potential Outside Information Triggered by Document:Arab oil embargo Committee to Reelect the President (CREEP) Containment Earth Day, 1970 Ellsberg, Daniel Fall of Saigon, 1975 Impoundment New Federalism New York Times v.

Other problems: high protective tariffs, demonetization of silver meant less capital for investment, lack of educated work force. • Northern investment. o Investors received concessions from southern state legislatures (land, forest, mineral rights). o Railroad companies laid over 22,000 miles of new track, but by 1890 more than half of track laid was owned by northern railroad companies.  • Industrial development. o Henry Grady, editor, Atlanta Constitution. o Industry developed: coal mining in Appalachians, textiles in Carolinas and Georgia, furniture, cigarette manufacturing (James B. Duke, American Tobacco Co., 1890), iron and steel in Birmingham, Alabama (by 1900, largest pig-iron shipper in the United States).  o Northern investors came to control some southern iron industry: Andrew Carnegie got railroads to charge higher freight rates through “Pittsburgh plus” pricing system that charged Birmingham steel an extra fee; New York bankers eventually controlled stock in southern iron firms; U.S. Steel bought out many Birmingham iron businesses.  o Northern businessmen invested in lumber industry in Gulf states’ pine forests; production increased 500 percent. o Railroads connected the South to national markets but charged higher rates for transport of manufactured goods than raw materials moving from South to North. o White merchants and industrialists prospered. • Cotton industry.  o Southern merchants and landowners promoted vertical integration of cotton industry; number of cotton mills grew: 161 in 1880, to 400 in 1900.   “Move the mill to the cotton.” oo Cotton manufacturing states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama; Augusta, Georgia, called the “Lowell of the South.” o Attracted northern investors (1880–1920), who owned major textile mills by 1920. o Mill towns in Piedmont (from Virginia, Carolinas, Alabama, and Georgia) were a mixture of industrial development and rural traditions; often controlled by mill owners who kept mill workers tied to the mill. o Textile workers were white and paid poorly; wages were 30–50 percent less than those for New England mill workers. • Labor. o Wages in industries were low for blacks and whites; lowest paid workers were children (child labor in textile industry was particularly widespread in South). o Some opportunities for African Americans: railroads, construction (Atlanta), mines, iron and steel furnaces, tobacco factories (black women), but workplaces were rigidly segregated, or blacks had menial jobs; southern urban areas attracted black unskilled labor.  o Cheap convict labor (often African Americans and often 90 percent of convict labor force) used in railroads, mines, lumber business; brutal mistreatment and no wages paid to convict workers. o African American women: domestic workers. Question 4 Information List (continued)  • Agriculture. o White planters prospered with reliance on cash crops. o Cotton and tobacco still dominated; hurt smaller farmers who could not withstand price changes in national and international markets; Louisiana cane sugar. o Rates of farm ownership were under 50 percent in South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. o Poor blacks and whites: sharecropping, tenant farming (by 1900, 70 percent of farmers in South were tenants), crop-lien system (encouraged debt and tied farmers to land); all impoverished black and white farmers and offered little hope for economic improvement. o Some black farmers got land (coastal South Carolina and Georgia) but less so in Deep South. o South still dependent on North for capital and manufactured goods.  o Southern share of national manufacturing was 10 percent in 1900, the same as it had been in 1860.  o South still had less total cotton-mill output than the North in 1900. o 1900: southern per capita income was 60 percent of national average; average income in South was 40 percent of income in North.   Politics • Solid South emerged; Democratic white voting bloc. • White Democrats controlled state governments: southern “home rule”/Redeemer governments/Bourbons. o Planters/merchants/businessmen who allied themselves with northern political conservatives and northern capitalists, but Bourbon politicians were not always unified. o Reduced taxes and cut public spending. o Decreased funding for public-school system for both races, but African Americans particularly hard hit. o Some funding for agricultural and mechanical colleges, teacher-training schools, and women’s colleges. • Some blacks still voted and held office from 1877 to 1914 (e.g., North Carolina: blacks in state Senate and House, 1877-90), but they saw more and more restrictions enforced at local levels. • Some biracial political coalitions at state level. o Virginia: black Republicans and anti-Redeemer Democrats formed Readjuster Movement (wanted to “readjust” state debt); governed Virginia from 1879 to 1883. o Tennessee, Arkansas. • Southern Farmers’ Alliances: began in Texas (1870s); spread to other southern states; excluded blacks; 1889 Charles W. Macune merged regional organizations into the Farmers’ Alliance and Industrial Union or Southern Alliance; by 1890, Alliances in South had elected 4 governors and 47 U.S. representatives and senators and controlled eight state legislatures.  • Colored Farmers’ National Alliance: first in Arkansas and then spread to other southern states; 1889, three million members; saw common economic complaints with white farmers; tried to organize strike of cotton pickers in South Carolina, Arkansas, and Texas in 1891, but white landowners and local authorities intervened to stop it. • Appeal of Populism (1892-96) to black and white farmers. o Tom Watson (Georgia), Leonidas Polk (North Carolina) appealed to farmers to unite regardless of race; “Pitchfork Ben” Tillman still used racist appeals (South Carolina). Question 4 Information List (continued)  o North Carolina, 1894-98: coalition of white Populists and black Republicans got control of state legislature, but ended with a revolt by white Democrats who reestablished control (ended with a riot in Wilmington in 1898, killing “scores of blacks”). o Southern Alliance split over issue of a third party, fearing Democratic Party in South would suffer. o Conservative white Redeemer/“Bourbons” countered with racial appeals to poor whites. o Populism defeated nationally in 1896 presidential election (William McKinley versus William Jennings Bryan). o Watson became a rabid supporter of white supremacy. • Disfranchisement of blacks, and some poor and illiterate whites, by state governments (1889–1908). o Poll taxes (Second Mississippi Plan, 1890). o Literacy tests; “understanding” tests of state constitutions. o Grandfather clauses: first passed in Louisiana in 1898; declared unconstitutional in Guinn v. United States (1915). o White Democratic primaries adopted by every southern state, 1896–1915. o 1900: Senate defeat of Lodge Bill (southern Democrats called it the “force bill”) that allowed “federal supervision of congressional elections to prevent disfranchisement, fraud or violence.”  o Williams v. Mississippi (1898): upheld Mississippi’s institution of poll taxes and literacy tests. o Giles v. Harris (1903): Supreme Court refused to hear a lower court case involving a black man who sued the Alabama state legislature for including various requirements in the state constitution that were designed to keep blacks from voting.  Race Relations • Most advocates of the “New South” championed white supremacy. • Social behavior was determined by race; whites expected deferential treatment by African Americans in public settings.  • By 1900, 20 percent of southern blacks were urban. • Black urban communities saw growth of black middle class (teachers, physicians, lawyers, nurses; working in banks and insurance companies; businessmen in black community; National Association of Colored Women 1896: urban black middle-class women sought women’s rights and racial uplift; black teachers’ colleges; Negro Business Men’s Leagues, 1898). o 1890s: more resentment by whites of signs of black success, social influence, education; whites feared loss of control of politics, particularly as the first generation of educated blacks born after the Civil War were more aware of the lack of equality. • Labor market segregated; blacks excluded from supervisory and white-collar jobs; more black women than white women were wage earners (often domestic servants). • Most labor unions excluded blacks. • Exodusters migrated to Kansas, 1879-80. • Civil Rights Cases (1883): declared Civil Rights Act 1875 (prohibited segregation in places of public accommodation) unconstitutional.  • Jim Crow laws passed by southern states (1880s and 1890s). • Plessy v. Ferguson (1896): “separate but equal” doctrine (supported by some “New South” advocates). • Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education (1899): Supreme Court upheld separate schools for blacks and whites, even if the black schools were not comparable to those of whites. Question 4 Information List (continued)  • Racial violence, 1880–1910. o Ku Klux Klan activity (despite federal government’s attempt to suppress the Klan through the Force Acts, 1870-71). o Race riots (Wilmington, North Carolina, 1898; New Orleans, 1900; Atlanta, 1906). o Lynching of blacks became more common, particularly in 1880s and 1890s, and in some cases, public spectacles (lynching of Sam Hose in Georgia in 1899); 1889–1909: over 1,700 African Americans were lynched in the South; lynching peaked during periods of falling cotton prices and the heightened competition between poor whites and poor blacks for jobs; peak in 1892 with appeals of Populists. o Ida B. Wells, prominent African American antilynching crusader: part owner of Memphis newspaper, Free Speech and Headlight; wrote Southern Horrors, 1892, and A Red Record, 1895. • Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Du Bois. o Booker T. Washington (a southerner) favored self-help for African Americans; favored economic independence and vocational trades education; acquiesced to social inequality and segregation; speech at Atlanta Exposition, 1895: “Atlanta Compromise” meant accommodation for blacks in the South; headed Tuskegee Institute in 1881. o W. E. B. Du Bois (a northerner) countered Washington; Souls of Black Folk, 1903; wanted an immediate end to disfranchisement and legal segregation; favored higher education and political activism among African Americans. • Public education for blacks in South was poor. o 1900: no public high schools for blacks in the South. o 1910: 8,000 of 970,000 high-school-age blacks in South enrolled in high schools.  o 1916: Bureau of Education study—per capita spending in South (white children: $10.32 per year; black children, $2.89 per year).  • 1900: 90 percent of U.S. African American population lived in the South. • 1880s-90s: Idea of the “Old South” and the “Lost Cause” gained popularity among southern whites, as did the idea of “happy slaves and the evils of Reconstruction” that legitimated segregation and denial of voting rights to African Americans (Birth of a Nation, 1915); exacerbated by southern state governments’ pension systems (often controlled by white patronage) for Confederate veterans.  • African Americans built their own culture, particularly around the church (provided community and political space, leadership roles for men, a vehicle for racial pride) and black social/fraternal organizations (Independent Order of Odd Fellows had 40,000 members in 1904; black women’s clubs). • National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) founded 1909-10.  • Segregation of the races and white domination of all aspects of southern society. • Great Migration of African Americans from South to northern industrial cities during World War I.  Question 5  Presidential elections between 1928 and 1948 revealed major shifts in political party loyalties. Analyze both the reasons for these changes and their consequences during this period.  The 8–9 Essay • Contains a clear, well-developed thesis that examines how the elections between 1928 and 1948 revealed major shifts in political party loyalties including both the reasons for these changes and their consequences during this period. • Develops the thesis with substantial and relevant historical information regarding both the reasons for and consequences of shifts in political party loyalties revealed by the elections between 1928 and 1948. • Provides effective analysis of the reasons for/consequences of major shifts in political party loyalties revealed by the elections between 1928 and 1948; treatment of the elections, reasons for shifts, and consequences may be unbalanced. o  Discussion of all individual elections is not expected. • May contain minor errors that do not detract from the overall quality of the essay. • Is well organized and well written.  The 5–7 Essay • Contains a thesis, which may be partially developed, that addresses the reasons for and consequences of the major shifts in political party loyalties revealed by the elections between 1928 and 1948. • Supports the thesis with some relevant supporting information. • Provides some analysis of the reasons for/consequences of major shifts in political party loyalties revealed by the elections between 1928 and 1948; treatment may be unbalanced.  o Discussion of all elections not required. o Reasons for shifts and consequences of changes may be blurred.  • May contain errors that do not seriously detract from the quality of the essay. • Has acceptable organization and writing.   The 2–4 Essay • Contains a weak or unfocused thesis or simply paraphrases the question. • Provides few relevant facts; or lists facts with little or no application to the question. • Provides simplistic analysis that may be generally descriptive or addresses only one reason or consequence. • May contain major errors. • May be poorly organized and/or written.  The 0–1 Essay • Lacks a thesis or simply restates the question. • Has little or no understanding of the question. • Contains substantial factual errors. • Is poorly organized and/or written.  The — Essay • Is completely off topic or blank.  Question 5 Information List    Election of 1928  Basics  Republicans  • Candidates: President—Herbert Hoover (Iowa); Vice President—Charles Curtis (former Senate majority leader, from Kansas).  • Political platform: continue Coolidge prosperity, probusiness. • Personal characteristics: midwestern (Iowa) roots appealed to rural voters, personally opposed Prohibition but endorsed it as a “noble social experiment,” “dry” candidate, supporter of business, self-made man.  Democrats  • Candidates: President—Alfred Smith (New York); Vice President—Joseph Robinson.  • Political platform: weak, hard to challenge Republican prosperity, tried to charge Hoover’s expansion of the Department of Commerce as socialism. • Personal characteristics: New York City (negative connection among southern, midwestern, and rural voters), Catholic, opposed Prohibition (“wet” candidate), Tammany Hall connection.  Results • Popular vote: Hoover 58 percent; Smith 41 percent.  Reasons for Shifts in Political Party Loyalties  • Republicans: loss of working class; voters in 12 largest cities voted Democrat.  • Farmers switch loyalties: not part of prosperity due to post–World War II lessening of demand for farm products and lower exports; Coolidge’s veto of farm bills connects Republican Party with unwillingness to aid farmers. • Democrats: southern Democrats shifted to the Republicans; first break in Solid South. Why? Anti-Catholic, anti-urban, nativist/anti-immigrant sentiments, influence of the KKK.  Consequences of Changes During This Period   • New coalition of urban workers and dissatisfied farmers will form; Democratic Party becomes the party of the urban working class. • End of the “log cabin” campaign; rural background will be seen as a social disadvantage.   Question 5 Information List (continued)  Election of 1932  Basics  Republicans  • Candidates: President—Herbert Hoover (Iowa); Vice President—Charles Curtis (former Senate majority leader, from Kansas).  • Political platform: world depression was to blame for United States Great Depression; belief in “rugged individualism.” • Personal characteristics: attitude toward the Depression was denial, then appeared pessimistic and ineffectual; often considered stiff and robotic.  Democrats  • Candidates: President—Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR), governor of New York; Vice President—John Nance Garner (Texas); served as President Woodrow Wilson’s assistant secretary of the navy. • Political platform: promises a “New Deal,” “experimentation” to fight the Depression; blamed Republican spending and Hoover’s inaction for problems; few specific plans were proposed; basic conservative view of the economy, no radical proposals. • Personal characteristics: wealthy family background, governor of New York, physical limitations due to polio; campaign inspired feeling of optimism—radio broadcasts, “Roosevelt Special” train.  Others  • Socialists, communists, and others.  • Political platform: country has serious problems that the two major parties cannot fix.   Results • Popular vote: FDR, 57 percent; Hoover, 40 percent; others, 3 percent. • Electoral vote: FDR, 472; Hoover, 59. • States: FDR, 42; Hoover, 6.  Issues • The Great Depression: blamed Hoover (“Hoovervilles,” “Hoover blankets,” “Hoover flags,” “Hoover cars”); soup lines and street-side apple stands became Depression symbols.  • Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC): new federal institution designed to help banks, railroads and other businesses; RFC left Hoover open to charges that he wanted to help businesses but not the jobless.   • Prohibition (Eighteenth Amendment). • The Bonus Army: backlash against Hoover. • Tariffs: Smoot–Hawley Tariff of 1930.  Question 5 Information List (continued)  Reasons for Shifts in Political Party Loyalties  • Republicans: people voted as they were affected by the Depression. The six states carried by Hoover were all in the Northeast, a stronghold of business and banking. • Democrats: carried all parts of the country including black voters, Catholics, farmers, immigrants, and urban workers. • Reemergence of the Socialist Party is evidence of dissatisfaction and desperation among the voters.  • FDR demonstrated pragmatism and flexibility, endorsing traditional Democratic themes, such as balanced budgets and limited government spending, while also advocating increased government regulation and planning. • Unequal distribution of wealth: the rich grew richer and the poor more impoverished. • Support from progressives: FDR won considerable support from progressive Republicans because of his family name and also adopting many of their issues.  • Unemployment in industrial regions such as the Midwest persuaded many Republican voters to vote Democratic.  Consequences of Changes During This Period  • Democrats were labeled as “liberals,” and Republicans labeled as “conservatives.” • Voters have expectations of presidential/government action in times of economic trouble. • FDR’s win transcended region—truly a national victory. Hoover’s six states were all in the Northeast and New England (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont). • Marked the beginning of Democratic majorities (House in 1930 and Senate in 1932) in Congress, allowing FDR to win easy passage of New Deal legislation during his first term. • Women, who had mostly voted Republican since passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, began to join the Democratic Party. • Young voters supported FDR, and many of them stayed Democratic for the rest of their lives.  • FDR’s administration encouraged pluralism (journalist Joseph Alsop said FDR “included the excluded”). Appointed Catholic judges and an unofficial “black cabinet” of high-ranking administration appointees who advocated for civil rights.    Election of 1936  Basics  Republicans  • Candidates: President—Alf Landon (Kansas); Vice President— Frank Knox.  • Political platform: condemned New Deal and demanded that federal relief programs be turned over to states (Landon admired the goals of New Deal but opposed methods). Democrats’ waste, inefficiency, and antibusiness philosophy were impeding recovery; “Landon Slide.”  Question 5 Information List (continued)  Democrats  • Candidates: President—Franklin D. Roosevelt (New York) renominated; Vice President—John Nance Garner (Texas) renominated.  • Political platform: praise and expansion of New Deal; Republicans portrayed as the party of economic disaster.   Others  • Union Party: William Lemke; coalition of supporters of Townsend, Coughlin, and Long. • Political platform: party of the disenfranchised; country still has serious problems that the two major parties cannot fix.   Results • Popular vote: FDR, 61 percent; Landon, 37 percent; others, 2.6 percent. • Electoral vote: FDR, 98 percent; Landon, 2 percent.  Issues • Continued unemployment.  Reasons for Shifts in Political Party Loyalties  • National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) endorsed Roosevelt for federal recovery programs that aided the poor (in spite of harm done to blacks by Agricultural Adjustment Act [AAA]). Ninety-five percent of black voters voted for FDR (from nearly 75 percent voting Republican in 1932). • Northern cities continued move to Democratic Party in 1936, as Roosevelt worked to shift Democratic support “from acreage to population.”  • Roosevelt’s message molded somewhat by rhetorical challenges by Huey Long, Francis Townsend, and Charles Coughlin.  Consequences of Changes During This Period   • NAACP endorsement marked fundamental and historic shift of African Americans from the party of Lincoln to the Democrats. • Blacks became central element of Democratic coalition ever since, in spite of discriminatory elements of Social Security, Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA), Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), Works Progress Administration (WPA), and National Recovery Administration (NRA). Popular African American criticism of New Deal.  • Cities largely remained Democratic supporters through end of century. • Roosevelt attempts to pack the Supreme Court—little interference from court after that. • By the end of the 1930s, a New Deal coalition emerged that embraced farmers, older people, northern African Americans, urban poor, southern whites, and labor.    Question 5 Information List (continued)  Election of 1940  Basics  Republicans  • Candidates: President—Wendell Willkie; Vice President— Charles McNary. Willkie won only on sixth ballot at convention; former Democrat who broke with Democrats over Tennessee Valley Authority [TVA]). • Political platform: condemned New Deal for “regimentation” and administrative inefficiency. Criticized Roosevelt administration for military unpreparedness. Platform also called for two constitutional amendments: equal rights for women and limit presidency to two terms.  Democrats  • Candidates: President—Franklin D. Roosevelt renominated; Vice President— Henry Wallace (contested primaries against own Vice President John Nance Garner and Postmaster General James Farley) • Political platform: praise of New Deal successes; pledged to keep the United States out of World War II, although called for maintaining a strong military as deterrent against aggression. Internationalism clearly came to the forefront.  Results • Popular vote: FDR, 55 percent; Willkie 45 percent. • Electoral vote: FDR, 85 percent; Willkie, 15 percent.  Issues • Supreme Court packing scheme.  • Rise of fascism, appeasement. • World War II, Lend–Lease.  Reasons for Shifts in Political Party Loyalties  • New Deal programs that helped underprivileged, plus Eleanor Roosevelt’s attention to racial injustices (e.g., Marion Anderson’s 1937 Easter Sunday concert on the Washington Mall) further encouraged African Americans to support the Democratic Party.  • Ninety-seven percent of blacks voted for FDR, in spite of the fact that large parts of New Deal overlooked blacks.  Consequences of Changes During This Period   • African Americans became solid element of the New Deal Democratic coalition—largely true until end of century. • Weapons sales to Great Britain vastly increased employment, as the nation anticipated United States entry into the war. • Democrats are labeled as “liberals” and Republicans labeled as “conservatives.” • Voters have expectations of presidential/government action in times of economic trouble.    Question 5 Information List (continued)  Election of 1944  Basics  Republicans  • Candidates: President—Thomas E. Dewey, governor of New York, former prosecutor; Vice President— John Bricker, senator from Ohio. • Personal characteristics: an internationalist and moderate progressive. Dewey endorsed most wartime policies at home and abroad and supported continuation of most New Deal programs such as Social Security, farm subsidies, and regulation of the banking industry; astute politician; Bricker personally disliked Dewey.  Democrats  • Candidates: President—FDR nominated for fourth term; Vice President—Harry S. Truman, senator from Missouri, • Political platform: war needed consistency in leadership; FDR respected as war president, revered by liberals (minorities, working class, farmers, and urban ethnics) for his New Deal programs. Increasingly despised by conservatives for turning the nation toward socialism with the New Deal, and for state management of key economic institutions to mobilize the nation for the war. Conservative Democrats remained loyal to the party thanks to the addition of Truman to the ticket.  Results • Popular vote: FDR, 53 percent; Dewey, 46 percent. • Electoral vote: FDR, 81 percent; Dewey, 19 percent.  Issues • People tired of war, rationing, economic controls.  Reasons for Shifts in Political Party Loyalties  • Republican conservatives played on concerns about length of war/sacrifices, but they were still tainted by Hoover’s Depression-era failures.  • Democratic victory resulted from FDR’s continued personal popularity, unwillingness to shift leaders as the Allies neared victory, and southern Democrats’ fears that Republican electoral victory would cost them control of congressional committees.  Consequences of Changes During This Period    • FDR died on April 12, 1945. Truman becomes president. He was a moderate Democrat who had minimal knowledge of wartime policy and FDR’s postwar diplomatic policy (no awareness of the Manhattan Project or most other key United States policies and initiatives).  • Truman was more confrontational than FDR with Stalin at Potsdam. • Angered progressive Democrats for canceling price controls but continuing wage controls. • Lacked the personal touch necessary to rally the Democrats in Congress.    Question 5 Information List (continued)  Election of 1948  Basics  Republicans  • Candidates: President—Thomas E. Dewey (New York); Vice President— Estes Kefauver. • Political platform: campaign of slogans: “To Err Is Truman,” “Had Enough?” “Confusion, corruption, and communism.” • Personal characteristics: Dewey looked like “the little man on the wedding cake.” Dewey confident of a victory; speeches were bland; among platitudes he uttered: “Unless labor is free, none of us are free”; “You know that your future is still ahead of you”; “Our rivers are full of fish.”   Democrats  • Candidates: President—Harry Truman; Vice President—Alben Barkley.  • Political platform: hold the course. Democratic slogans: “Give ‘em hell, Harry.” During September and October, Truman traveled more than 22,000 miles on a “whistle-stop” train tour. • Personal characteristics: Truman was compared to FDR. Republicans portrayed Truman as struggling in a job that was too large for him. Truman came across as a feisty and bold underdog, battling great odds to keep his job. He also appeared to be the champion of the common person.   Others  • Progressive: Henry Wallace, former vice president, former commerce secretary; Wallace accused of being a communist because he supported arms control with and a softer line toward the Soviet Union.  • States Rights Party (Dixiecrats): J. Strom Thurmond, governor of South Carolina; focused on states’ rights as a way to avoid the race card.   Results • Popular vote: Truman, 49.5 percent; Dewey, 45.1 percent; Thurmond, 2.4 percent;  others, 3 percent. • Electoral vote: Truman, 303; Dewey, 189; Thurmond, 39. • States: Truman, 28; Dewey, 16; Thurmond, 4 (South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana).   Issues • Communism and the Cold War: Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan, Loyalty Review Board, Berlin Airlift. • Economic problems: continued high taxes, double-digit inflation, shortages of critical goods (meat, cars, and appliances), and unemployment for returning veterans.  • Civil rights: desegregation of the armed forces; resulted in two splinter parties, Dixiecrats and Progressives, that caught Truman between the conservative South and Democratic liberals, respectively (the right and left wings of the Democratic Party).  • All polls and pundits called the election for Dewey. Newsweek predicted a Dewey “landslide.” During this election the Chicago Tribune famously printed the erroneous headline, “Dewey Defeats Truman.”  Question 5 Information List (continued)  Reasons for Shifts in Political Party Loyalties  • Economic problems: continued high taxes, double-digit inflation, shortages of critical goods (meat, cars, and appliances), and unemployment for returning veterans. Voters also blamed Truman for high taxes (“High Tax Harry”).  • In 1946 strikes paralyzed country as workers demanded higher wages. Truman seized key industries, including meatpacking, coal, oil, and railroads. Anger over the work stoppages led to Republican victories in the 1946 midterms. • The Fair Deal: Truman supported liberal legislation (despite the conservative direction of the Eightieth Congress) such as a higher minimum wage, repeal of the antilabor Taft–Hartley Act, and more public housing. Republican Congress’ antilabor legislation like Taft–Hartley Act made organized labor realize that it preferred a Democrat in the White House. • Truman’s campaign recognized the importance of black voters and courted them. • The New Deal coalition came through for Truman: labor, older people, urban residents, underprivileged people, farmers, Catholics, and northern African Americans voted for Truman, allowing the president to prevail even without full support from the Solid South.  Consequences of Changes During This Period  • Democratic Congress enacted some of Truman’s domestic initiatives, such as raising the minimum wage and providing more public housing (Housing Act of 1949), but Congress rejected most Fair Deal programs.  • During the Korean War, Truman desegregated the armed forces.  • Truman continued containment policies, which won bipartisan support. He sent United States ground troops to Korea beginning in 1950.   • Dewey’s defeat caused a temporary shift within the Republican Party favoring conservatives, which allowed Joe McCarthy and other senators to gain more power, stirred anticommunist concerns, and helped further fuel the Red Scare during the early 1950s. • Truman’s support of civil rights marked the Democratic Party’s change toward advocating African American causes and attracting black voters, thus moving away from conservative white southerners who began to break from the party, leaving a new Democratic coalition of northern liberals, urbanites, blacks, and organized labor.   Notes  • Balance not required, nor is discussion of all of the elections between 1928 and 1944. • Reasons for shifts and consequences of changes may be blurred.         AP® United States History 2008 Scoring Guidelines                 The College Board: Connecting Students to College Success   The College Board is a not-for-profit membership association whose mission is to connect students to college success and opportunity.
