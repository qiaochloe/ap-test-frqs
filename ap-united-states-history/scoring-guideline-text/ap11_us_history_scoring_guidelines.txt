temperance was partly an expression of the belief that immigrants’ use of liquor had to be “disciplined”; some Progressives saw Americanization as a way to break immigrants’ ethnic culture. • Popularization of ideas of racial hierarchy: eugenics; Madison Grant, The Passing of the Great Race, 1916; army IQ tests administered during WWI seemed to suggest that blacks and new immigrants had inferior intelligence to native, white Protestants. • Popular concepts of degrees of “whiteness” started to change into “absolute whiteness” and “absolute colored”;

women could not acquire citizenship by virtue of spouse’s status; rather, they had to apply on their own.  • Ozawa v. U.S. (1922): Japanese immigrants were unassimilable aliens and racially ineligible for U.S. citizenship; Supreme Court ruled that the definition of “race” was not a scientific one but instead based on the “understanding of the common man”; therefore “white persons,” the phrase in the law, meant northern and western Europeans. • U.S. v. Thind (1923): Asian Indian immigrants were unassimilable aliens and racially ineligible for U.S. citizenship. • 1924 Johnson–Reed Immigration Act (National Origins Act) — established National Origins Plan to begin in 1929:  ◦ Cut maximum annual immigration to 164,000 and reduced European quotas to 2 percent of each nationality in U.S. in 1890, thereby discriminating against southern and eastern Europeans. ◦ Excluded “aliens ineligible for citizenship” (east and south Asia, Japan; Chinese were already excluded by laws of 1882, 1892). ◦ Filipinos, Mexicans, and Canadians (western hemisphere) were exempted from the 1924 act. ◦ Prevented Asian women from joining their husbands in the U.S. ◦ Allowed all other foreign-born wives and children of U.S. citizens to enter as non-quota immigrants. ◦ Divided balance of world into “five colored races” (black, mulatto, Chinese, Japanese, Indian). ◦ Created a new category: “illegal alien.” • Hidemitsu v. U.S. (1925): forbade naturalization of Japanese (to maintain distinction of race and color in naturalization laws). • U.S. Border Patrol established in 1925; made border crossing from Mexico more difficult (head taxes, visa fees, literacy tests, document checks). • 1927 revised National Origins Act: ◦ Established new quotas to begin in 1929. ◦ Set annual limit of 150,000 immigrants; completely excluded Japanese. ◦ European quotas were decided in proportion to “national origins” (country of birth or descent) of continental U.S. inhabitants in 1920. ◦ Immigrants from western hemisphere (except “potential paupers” as defined by Labor Dept.) were excluded from quotas. Question 4 (continued)  • Mexicans subjected to discrimination: ◦ In employment and residence patterns. ◦ Often confined to barrios. ◦ Legal restrictions in some states on employment, such as teaching, legal profession, public works projects. ◦ Agribusiness interests tried to keep borders open, using racial stereotyping as their weapon (only Mexicans could perform physically demanding work “owing to their crouching and bending habits”).  ◦ School systems were segregated. • 1929 Anti-Filipino riots in CA resulted in 1934 legislation to eliminate immigration from the Philippines. Question 5  African American leaders have responded to racial discrimination in the United States in a variety of ways.
