Those who disregard America’s commitment to patriarchal rule and plead for a historical interpretation that favors enlightened exceptionalism have overlooked the conditions that made large-scale change all but impossible at that time and place.” Elaine Forman Crane, historian, Ebb Tide in New England: Women, Seaports, and Social Change, 1630–1800, published in 1998 “The coming of the American Revolution . . . created new opportunities for women to participate in politics. Responding to men’s appeals, women engaged in a variety of actions in support of the revolutionary cause, which led women to experience a greater sense of connection to and involvement with the polity. After the war their political contributions were praised, celebrated, and remembered. . . .Women now were seen as political beings who had the capacity to influence the course of war, politics, and history.” Rosemarie Zagarri, historian, Revolutionary Backlash: Women and Politics in the Early American Republic, published in 2007 Using the excerpts above, answer (a), (b), and (c). a) Briefly describe ONE major difference between Crane’s and Zagarri’s historical interpretations of the immediate impact of the American Revolution on women. b) Briefly explain how ONE event, development, or circumstance from the period 1765 to 1800 that is not explicitly mentioned in the excerpts could be used to support Crane’s argument. c) Briefly explain how ONE event, development, or circumstance from the period 1765 to 1800 that is not explicitly mentioned in the excerpts could be used to support Zagarri’s argument. Scoring Guide 0–3 points Score 3 Response accomplishes all three tasks set by the question. Score 2 Response accomplishes two of the tasks set by the question. Score 1 Response accomplishes one of the tasks set by the question. Score 0 Response accomplishes none of the tasks set by the question. Score NR No response.

Given the timed nature of the exam, responses may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. • Clarity: Exam responses should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. Examples of responses to (a) that would earn credit: • Crane argues that: o The American Revolution was not radical because it didn’t change women’s status in society. o Gender roles for women remained unchanged after the American Revolution. o The ideals of the American Revolution were not applied to women. • Zagarri argues that: o Women’s social status and social influence improved after the American Revolution. o Women were newly able to participate in the country’s politics. o Women were more visible in civic life/public sphere/society. NOTE: Credited responses for (a) must explicitly address the substance of both excerpts. Examples of responses to (b) that would earn credit: • Women could not vote (except in New Jersey, which also eventually rescinded this right). • Women were excluded from the rights stated for all men in the Declaration of Independence. • Women could not participate in any of the political decision-making after the American Revolution. • Abigail Adams asked her husband John Adams to make sure that men “remember the ladies,” but women were not involved in political decision-making. • The idea of republican motherhood gave women authority in the private sphere but kept them confined to the private sphere. • Married women did not have any recognized legal or property rights separate from their husbands. • Women were not allowed to fight in the Continental Army — adhering to gender roles. Short Answer Question 1 (continued) Examples of responses to (c) that would earn credit: • Women participated in Revolutionary protest (e.g., boycotts, protests, crowds, homespun movement, nonconsumption, Daughters of Liberty, Edenton tea party, Ladies of Philadelphia). • Women supported the Revolutionary effort (e.g., fundraising, camp followers, nurses, spies, cooks, Phillis Wheatley, Deborah Sampson, Molly Pitcher). • Women such as Abigail Adams acted as informal advisors to presidents and political leaders. • The idea of republican motherhood gave women a voice in the shaping of future republican citizens and an indirect role in public life. • Women applied Revolutionary principles to post-Revolutionary United States society (e.g., Elizabeth Freeman (aka Mumbet)). • Mercy Otis Warren evoked patriotism in published works on political subjects. • Judith Sargent Murray argued for women’s equality and advocated for women’s education beyond domestic tasks. • Academies for women offered new educational opportunities. • Women were able to vote in New Jersey between the late 1790s and early 1800s. • Divorce laws in some states were liberalized after the American Revolution. • After the Revolution, women were more apt to obtain custody of their children after divorce if the children were young. NOTE: It would be acceptable for test takers to use some of the same examples to respond to both (b) and (c) as long as the evidence is appropriate for each part of the question.

Given the timed nature of the exam, responses may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. • Clarity: Exam responses should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. Examples of responses to (a) that would earn credit: • Cash crops from the Chesapeake (such as tobacco) were typically shipped to England, while staple crops from the middle colonies (such as wheat) were typically shipped to the Caribbean. • The fur trade more extensive in the middle colonies and less extensive in the Chesapeake. • There was more diversity of trade in middle colonies (e.g., furs, various agricultural products), while trade was more narrowly focused on cash crops such as tobacco in the Chesapeake. • The Chesapeake was more dependent upon slave plantation agriculture than the middle colonies. • The middle colonies were more urban and had more port cities, while the Chesapeake was more rural and had fewer and smaller urban centers. • The middle colonies were societies with slaves (i.e., not socially dominated by slavery), versus the Chesapeake, which was a slave society (i.e., socially organized around the principles of chattel slavery). • Shipbuilding and lumbering were more prevalent industries in the middle colonies than they were in the Chesapeake region, which focused on cash crop agriculture. NOTE: Credited responses for (a) must address explicit differences between the Chesapeake and middle colonies. (e.g., A response like “The Chesapeake colonies had fertile soil and the middle colonies did not” is not sufficient to address the prompt.) NOTE: In the Chesapeake colonies, the use of cotton as the only cash crop will not be accepted; however, tobacco with cotton will be considered as a minor error and can be considered for credit. NOTE: The concepts of industrialization and the textile industry should not be accepted. The use of the term manufacturing must be used in conjunction with other activities that colonies were engaged in economically (e.g., farming, shipbuilding, lumbering, and fishing). NOTE: The use of the geographical terms “the North” and “the South” can be used as long as additional specific information is given in the response to reference the middle or Chesapeake colonies. Short Answer Question 3 (continued) Examples of responses to (b) that would earn credit: • Both the middle colonies and the Chesapeake engaged in export trade/the triangular trade. • Both the middle colonies and the Chesapeake were part of a mercantilist system centered on Great Britain. • Both the middle colonies and the Chesapeake exported raw goods to/imported finished goods from Great Britain. • Both the economies of the middle colonies and Chesapeake were based on agricultural production for export. • Both the middle and Chesapeake colonies had to pay taxes to England (the response must mention either the Navigation Acts or the mercantilist system). Examples of responses to (c) that would earn credit: • Waterways in the Chesapeake were suitable for transport of cash crops produced closer to the coast, while waterways in the middle colonies (e.g., the Hudson, Susquehanna, and Delaware Rivers), which included New Netherlands, were more readily navigable and went deeper into the interior of North American, facilitating regional commerce and the fur trade with Native Americans. • The climate of the Chesapeake region was suitable for valuable cash crops that required a longer growing season as opposed to the cooler climate of the middle colonies that allowed for grain crops to be grown. • Development of large-scale slavery in the Chesapeake facilitated cash crop production, as opposed to the smaller scale of slavery and a greater dependency on indentured servants and immigrant labor in the middle colonies. • Virginia was founded by joint-stock company investors seeking profit on investments, while the middle colonies were founded by more diverse European settlers, including religious refugees and individuals seeking improved economic autonomy and opportunities. NOTE: Earning the point for (c) is not contingent on earning the point for (a). NOTE: A credited response to (c) could be a reason for a difference established in (a).

(e.g., A response like ‘The Great Society addressed civil rights issues, but the New Deal did not” is not sufficient to address the prompt.) NOTE: Credited responses for (b) must elaborate beyond chronological differences. Short Answer Question 4 (continued) Examples of responses to (c) that would earn credit: • The New Deal was a response to an economic depression, while the Great Society was a response to the persistent problem of poverty in a prosperous economy. • The Great Society took place during and in response to the civil rights movement, while the New Deal reflected the racism of the era prior to the civil rights movement in American politics. • The New Deal political coalition included many southern Democrats who supported racial discrimination (although it did feature incremental symbolic progress on racial issues), while the Great Society response to pressure from civil rights activists led many southerners to leave the Democratic Party. • The Great Society could build upon the accomplishments of the New Deal, whereas the intervention of the federal government in society and economy during the New Deal was unprecedented. • The Vietnam War constrained the accomplishments of the Great Society, while the New Deal could be more expansive partly because the United States was uninvolved in significant international engagements at the time. NOTE: Earning the point for (c) is not contingent on earning the point for (b). NOTE: A credited response to (c) could be a reason for a difference established in (b). If the response in (c) is a continuation that addresses the same explicit difference established in (b), the response can earn credit if it only addresses one topic. Question 1 — Document-Based Question Evaluate the extent to which the Progressive movement fostered political change in the United States from 1890 to 1920. Maximum Possible Points: 7 Points  Rubric  Notes  A: Thesis/Claim (0–1)  Responds to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis/claim that establishes a line of reasoning. (1 point) To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt rather than restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion.  The thesis must make a historically defensible claim that establishes a line of reasoning about how the Progressive movement fostered political change in the United States from 1890 to 1920. Examples that earn this point include: • “The Progressive movement was incredibly successful in fostering political change such as trust busting large monopolies and reforming the criminal justice system for youth and adults; however, their failure to advance African American civil rights sufficiently left a significant scar on their legacy, as many issues of discrimination such as segregation and Jim Crow were prolonged.” • “The Progressive Movement in the United States from 1890 to 1920 fostered great political change,  such as rooting out corruption in government, eliminating monopolies in business, and by advocating rights for those who had been discriminated against.” • “The Progressive movement fostered political change in the United States because it sought for a deeper respect for democracy, equal and equitable rights for all people, and it applied new ways of thinking to services within America.”  B: Contextualization(0–1)  Describes a broader historical context relevant to the prompt.

Given the timed nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. • Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 point) Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible claim that establishes a line of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion. Examples of acceptable theses: • “The Progressive movement was incredibly successful in fostering political change such as trust busting large monopolies and reforming the criminal justice system for youth and adults; however, their failure to advance African American civil rights sufficiently left a significant scar on their legacy, as many issues of discrimination such as segregation and Jim Crow were prolonged.” (This example suggests a historically defensible line of argument development and establishes the main analytical categories of the response, including a counterargument.) • “The Progressive Movement in the United States from 1890 to 1920 fostered great political change, such as rooting out corruption in government, eliminating monopolies in business, and by advocating rights for those who had been discriminated against.” (This example suggests a historically defensible line of argument development and establishes the main analytical categories of the response.) • “While the Progressive movement achieved goals in the improvement of cities and the protection of children, the movement ultimately failed in increasing democracy due to the fact that democratic rights were not extended to African Americans.” (This example suggests a historically defensible line of argument development and establishes the main analytical categories of the essay.) • “The Progressive movement fostered political change in the United States because it sought for a deeper respect for democracy, equal and equitable rights for all people, and it applied new ways of thinking to services within America.” (This example suggests a historically defensible line of argument development and establishes the main analytical categories of the essay.) Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Examples of unacceptable theses: • “The Progressive movement caused political change to a large extent because it influenced so many different areas of politics that were able to change at the time.” (This example largely restates the prompt.) • “Political, social, and economic change occurred during the Progressive Era.” (This example is too vague and does not establish a line of reasoning.) • “During the time period of 1890 to 1920, the Progressive movement fostered political change in the United States as new ideas were being spread and as a result of new policies being instituted.” (This example is too vague and does not establish a line of reasoning.) B. Contextualization (0–1 point) Responses earn 1 point by describing a broader historical context relevant to the topic of the prompt. To earn this point, the response must accurately and explicitly connect the context of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that occurred before, during, or continued after the time frame of the question. This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference. To earn the point, the response must accurately describe a context relevant to how the Progressive movement fostered political change in the United States from 1890 to 1920. Examples of context might include: • The expansion of industrialization • The growth of cities • The development of large-scale immigration from southern and eastern Europe • The consolidation of corporations into large trusts • The government adherence to laissez-faire economics Examples of acceptable contextualization: • “The mid-nineteenth century was a booming time for urbanization, immigration, and industrialization. Towns and cities started moving skyward, people from Europe came to America in hopes of achieving the American dream, and industries such as steel and textiles were booming in the wake of a new work force. The amount and quality of work in America began to highlight deficiencies in America beyond the workforce. The Progressive movement began in response to this.” (This example describes a broader historical context relevant to the topic of the prompt.) • “At the time of 1890, the Gilded Age had been going on for approximately 20 years. The Gilded Age was the time when large corporations and ‘robber barons’ came to power. Trusts such as John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil were in power and they had monopolies, snuffing out smaller competition under the guise of Social Darwinism, a principle saying only the strong survive in the business world. This leads into the progressive movement.” (This example describes a broader historical context relevant to the topic of the prompt.) Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Examples of unacceptable contextualization: • “In 1890 the census of 1890 concludes that there is no more American frontier. President McKinley is finishing the Spanish American War in 1898 when he gets shot and passes the presidency off to Theodore Roosevelt who helps the country with progressivism.” (This example did not earn credit for contextualization because it is presenting evidence that is not clearly relevant to how the Progressive movement fostered political change in the United States.) • “During the mid-1800s there was a great divide in the U.S. This divide was between slavery ultimately it led to a war which in the end damaged the U.S. It not only damaged U.S. morale, but also damaged many parts of the South and more greatly the economy. The divide was due to many disagreements which was somewhat warned by Washington who said don’t form political parties because they would cause a divide among the states.” (This example did not earn credit for contextualization because it does not provide any evidence that is relevant to how the Progressive movement fostered political change in the United States.) C. Evidence (0–3 points) Evidence from the Documents In order to earn 1 point for using evidence from the documents, the response must address the topic of the prompt by using at least three documents. To earn 1 point for evidence from the documents, the response must accurately describe — rather than simply quote or paraphrase — content from at least three of the documents to address the topic of the prompt. Examples of describing the content of a document: • “Document 6 says that with the introduction of new technology the man power in the police department can now be used to keeping the city safer which taxpayers hope for.” (This example describes evidence from the documents relevant to the topic, so it contributes toward the first evidence point, but it does not use that evidence to support an argument about the extent to which the Progressive movement caused political change in the United States, so it does not contribute toward the second point.) • “Teddy Roosevelt in Document 2 is saying that the state needs to control these business corporations that are becoming too powerful. They’re benefitting themselves instead of the workers.” (This example correctly describes the content of Document 2, but it does not use that evidence to support an argument that is relevant to the Progressive movement fostering political change in the United States.) Examples of unacceptably describing the content of a document: • “In the 1890s ‘when [Alderman] protected a lawbreaker from the legal consequences his kindness appeared […] when Hull House on the other hand insisted that law must be enforced, it could but appear as the persecution of the offender’ (Doc. 1).”(This example simply quotes from Document 1 and does not use the content of this document to address the topic of the prompt.) • “Wilson, in Document 5, is telling us that African Americans are being separated from whites in the work force so they can be protected from discrimination.” (This example is a misunderstanding of Document 5. The response attributes the document to President Wilson instead of the NAACP and misunderstands the content of the document.) Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) OR Document Content — Supporting an Argument Responses earn 2 points by using the content of at least six documents to support an argument that responds to the prompt. To earn 2 points, responses must accurately describe the document’s content; they cannot earn a point by merely quoting or paraphrasing the documents with no connection to the topic of the prompt. Examples of supporting an argument using the content of a document: • “In a letter to Wilson, the NAACP points out to segregationists that by having segregation, especially in the Federal government, promotes inequality (Doc. 5). Virtually no political change came about for black people during this time.” (This example uses Document 5 to support an argument that the Progressive era did not bring about political change for African Americans.) • “In keeping with this idea of the rights of children, the Progressive movement also aligned with the temperance movement for the protection of families. The temperance movement aimed at abolishing alcohol, and was commonly supported by mothers, who saw the detrimental effects of alcohol leading to the abuse of mothers and children within the family. The political cartoon encouraged voters to ‘Vote Dry’ in favor of politicians who opposed the consumption of alcohol (Doc. 7).” (This example connects the content of Document 7 to an argument about how the Progressive movement attempted to protect families and the rights of children.) Example of unacceptably supporting an argument using the content of a document: • “The Departments at Washington had segregated employees so the NAACP requested that President Wilson desegregate them (Doc. 5). Some may argue that because of this segregation, it must have meant that progressive reform had no impact, but that is not the case because later it would be required by law to desegregate work places.” (This example describes the content of Document 5 but uses this document to support an erroneous argument that desegregation in the workplace will eventually be achieved because of the Progressive Era.) • “Document 7 says that people should vote for prohibition to help the mothers and children in the country.” (This example is a correct description of Document 7 and would achieve credit for using the content of a document to address the topic of Progressivism. However, this example does not tie its observation about Document 7 to an argument about how the Progressive movement fostered political change in the United States.) Evidence Beyond the Documents In order to earn 1 point for evidence beyond the documents, the response must use at least one additional piece of specific historical evidence (beyond that found in the documents) relevant to an argument that addresses the topic. To earn this point, the evidence must be described and must be more than a phrase or reference. This additional piece of evidence must be different from the evidence used to earn the point for contextualization. Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as supporting evidence beyond the documents will typically be more specific details that function as support for a particular point made in an argument, analogous to the function of evidence drawn from the documents. Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Evidence used might include the following, with appropriate elaboration: • Muckrakers could be used as evidence of the spread of concern in the United States over the negative effects of industrialization and the advocacy for political action to alleviate these effects. • The Populist (People’s) Party could be used as evidence of the influence on Progressive thought of economic reform efforts based in rural areas. • The Federal Reserve Act (1913) could be used as evidence of the political change made by new federal government regulation of the national money supply. • The passage of the Clayton Anti-Trust Act (1914) could be used as evidence of political change made by Progressives to counter the reduction in economic competition caused by corporate consolidation. • The North American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) could be used as evidence of a Progressive reform effort that changed United States politics by helping to expand the electorate by pressing for women’s voting rights. • Muckrakers • Populist (People’s) Party • Federal Reserve Act (1913) • Clayton Anti-Trust Act (1914) • North American Woman Suffrage Association • Eugene V. Debs • W. E. B. Du Bois • Henry Ford • Robert La Follette • New Freedom (associated with Woodrow Wilson) • New Nationalism (associated with Theodore Roosevelt) • Prohibition • Sherman Anti-Trust Act (1890) • Upton Sinclair, The Jungle • William Howard Taft • Frederick W. Taylor Examples of acceptable use of an additional piece of specific historical evidence: • “Another example of successful use of government to enact change was the women’s rights movement, in which the work of suffragists to gain the 19th amendment was clearly more effective for enacting fully-recognized change than the smaller-scale and less ambitious idea of Republican Motherhood.” (This example uses a particular piece of evidence beyond the documents to make a connection to a larger argument.) • “One effective Progressive reform would be that which was started by the book The Jungle. This book sought to expose the dangerous conditions workers suffered in the meat factories of Chicago and President Roosevelt immediately took action after the book, calling for legislation to be implemented, investigations to be done, and the FDA to be established — all of which would see to more political power for the Federal government.” (This example uses The Jungle to support an argument about increasing the regulatory powers of the federal government during the Progressive Era.) Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Examples of unacceptable use of an additional piece of specific historical evidence: • “Many organizations formed in response to this [Document 5] and pushed for political change by going on marches, such as the March on Washington.” (This example would not earn credit because it is historically inaccurate.) • “They had people begin voting for Senators.” (This example is the start of an acceptable discussion, but the allusion to the Seventeenth Amendment is no more than a brief reference and is not fully described.) D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points) Document Sourcing For at least three documents, the response explains how or why the document’s point of view, purpose, historical situation, and/or audience is relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt. To earn this point, the response must explain how or why — rather than simply identifying — the document’s point of view, purpose, historical situation, or audience is relevant to an argument addressing the prompt for each of the three documents sourced. Example of an acceptable explanation of the relevance of the document’s point of view: • “Couzens’ point of view [Doc. 6] comes from the fact that he had been the manager for Ford Motor Company which created the efficient assembly line, so he would try to implement the success of the Ford Motor Co. into the police departments.” (This example correctly identifies Couzens’s point of view as that of a former manager for Ford Motor Company and connects it to an argument about why reformers would want to improve the efficiency of urban police departments.) Example of an unacceptable explanation of the relevance of the document’s point of view: • “Addams’ point of view comes as she is the founder of Hull House, illustrating that these were observations she obtained herself.” (This example does not contribute toward a point for document sourcing because it inaccurately discusses the relevance of Addams’s point of view.) Example of an acceptable explanation of the relevance of the document’s purpose: • “Thus, many of these state reforms [Doc. 4] had the purpose of eventually creating national change by means of say, an amendment such as the 17th amendment that gave voters direct election of their senators, however, national change was not always seen.” (This example contributed toward a point for document sourcing because it correctly identifies Johnson’s purpose in supporting several political reforms.) Example of an unacceptable explanation of the relevance of the document’s purpose: • “This letter [Doc. 5] has the purpose to ask President Woodrow Wilson to change the legislative policies of the time so that there can be more equal opportunities for Blacks.” (This example does not contribute toward a point for document sourcing because it only describes the content of Document 5 and is not adding any insight into the relevance of the NAACP’s purpose in writing this letter to President Wilson.) Example of an acceptable explanation of the relevance of the historical situation of a document: • “Roosevelt, in Document 2, advocated for much more power for the President to supervise and control trusts. Roosevelt was able to control the trusts as a result of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.” (This example contributes to a point for document sourcing because it links the historical situation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act to an argument about Roosevelt increasing the power of the federal government.) Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Example of an unacceptable explanation of the relevance of the historical situation of a document: • “Document 3 shows how the Progressive movement led to government regulation because at the time Chicago was a major city with lots of Progressive influence.” (This example does not contribute toward a point for document sourcing because it does not explain why the fact that “Chicago was a major city” is relevant in understanding the document.) Example of an acceptable explanation of the relevance of the audience: • “Document 6 says that segregation continued in government and insulted progressive efforts on behalf of African Americans. It is significant that the NAACP is addressing President Wilson because Wilson claimed to be a Progressive but they are pointing out that he was harming efforts for improved civil rights for African Americans.” (This example contributes to a point for document sourcing because it explains the relevance of the audience of the NAACP’s letter that President Wilson “claimed to be a Progressive.”) Example of an unacceptable explanation of the relevance of the audience: • “Hiram Johnson’s audience in Doc. 4 was the people of California.” (This example does not contribute to a point for document sourcing because it just restates information provided about the document and does not explain how or why this information is relevant to an argument about Progressivism.) Demonstrating Complex Understanding The response demonstrates a complex understanding, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the question. Demonstrating a complex understanding might include: • Explaining a nuance by exploring the contradiction that Progressivism supported greater political participation but also supported increased government power over people • Explaining similarities and differences in different Progressive reform movements such as social reform in cities, economic regulation, and Prohibition • Explaining connections to other time periods, such as the reform efforts of the first half of the nineteenth century • Confirming the validity of the response’s argument about the greater role of the government in people’s lives across themes by explaining how foreign policy in the Progressive Era involved United States intervention into the affairs of its new colonies and foreign countries • Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering evidence that shows the limitations on the Progressive movement in achieving political change This understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference. Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Examples of acceptable demonstration of a complex understanding: • This response uses multiple pieces of evidence to corroborate its argument that the Progressive movement was both a local and a national movement to fight political corruption. The response uses content from Documents 3, 4, and 5 to corroborate this claim, and it also weaves in evidence beyond the documents about muckraking and W. E. B. DuBois to further support this sophisticated argument. This paragraph begins by saying, “Between 1890 and 1920, there was notable change in the fact that local political reforms and nationwide social reforms both exposed the corruptness of the political atmosphere, using propaganda and local campaigns to tackle a nationwide epidemic of political corruption.” The response then qualifies its argument by stating, “However, there is a greater change in the fact that no local and social reforms could combat the spoils system and big business’ effect on politics. . . . In Doc. 2, Roosevelt explains that big corporations need to be controlled and supervised. Roosevelt’s intended audience was big business to warn them of the fact that they cannot keep control of politics forever, and the American people to encourage them to have hope that reform will be made. Roosevelt further developed these ideas when running for the Progressive Bull Moose party in 1912 against Wilson. Roosevelt’s speech shows that the power of big business over politics was so grand that it needed control, showing a continuation in their omnipotence in politics despite criticism from progressives.” Ultimately, this response demonstrates a complex understanding of how the Progressive movement fostered political change but also the political and economic forces that ultimately limited this change. • This response demonstrates a complex understanding of the Progressive Era by qualifying its argument. “Lastly, while the progressive movement led to some political achievements in increasing the democracy of voters, it failed to achieve true protection of democratic principles in that Black voters were still limited in terms of their voting rights. During the progressive movement, many democratic ideals were seen at the state level. Most notably was the initiative, referendum, and recall programs established by many state governments.” The response then uses multiple pieces of evidence, such as Document 4 and a discussion of the 17th Amendment, to support the argument that some reforms were aimed at expanding democratic principles. The response then qualifies this argument by stating, “However, national change was not always seen. Under the Woodrow Wilson presidency, Woodrow Wilson would segregate White House offices and would clearly support racism, perhaps best seen through his viewing of The Birth of a Nation at the White House, a film endorsed by the KKK which viewed the Civil War as a war for the struggle of white people, not African slaves. In response to these racist policies, interest groups such as the NAACP called out Wilson for his failure to protect the rights of black people, despite other Progressive Era reforms already occurring (Doc. 5). . . . The NAACP was frustrated with America, after all, the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments which aimed at abolishing slavery, granting equal protection under the law and granting all blacks the right to vote, were not protecting people in the shadow of sharecropping, segregation, and Jim Crow laws.” The entire response is rich with evidence and demonstrates a complex understanding of the Progressive Era. This lengthy paragraph, in particular, offers a sophisticated qualification to its argument. Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Example of unacceptably demonstrating complex understanding: • The following response attempts to explain relevant and insightful connections within and across time periods, but it does not quite demonstrate a complex understanding of the Progressive Era nor does it clearly use evidence to corroborate or qualify its argument. “While progressives accomplished and bettered American society overall, the long-term impacts on the African American community and our failure to learn from mistakes of the Anti-Saloon League and Dry Movement plague us today. Ending discriminatory practices would have made Black Americans’ situations better in the long run but that did not happen. Legislators chose to enact the ‘War on Drugs,’ showing how we were unable to learn from the Progressives’ failures in reducing trafficking and drug crime. The importance of the Progressive Era cannot be understated, but we must remain objective in our assessments, criticizing the negatives as well.” Ultimately, while this is a noble attempt at demonstrating a complex understanding of the Progressive Era, the response is somewhat simplistic, and the references to modern society are not fully developed. Question 2 — Long Essay Question Evaluate the extent to which ideas of self-government influenced American colonial reaction to British imperial authority in the period from 1754 to 1776. Maximum Possible Points: 6 Points  Rubric  Notes  A: Thesis/Claim (0–1)  Thesis/Claim: Responds to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis/claim that establishes a line of reasoning. (1 point) To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt rather than restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion.  The thesis must make a historically defensible claim that establishes a line of reasoning about how ideas of self-government influenced American colonial reaction to British imperial authority from 1754 to 1776. Examples that earn this point include: • “Although these taxes are considered to be the reasoning behind the American Revolution, the impending war was more so about the need for individual freedom and republican government that the British deprived them of after the end to salutary neglect.”  • “During the era of the Enlightenment, colonists clung to these ideas of Republicanism and self-government and used them to justify opposition to Britain’s economic control and political control of the colonies.”  B: Contextualization(0–1)  Contextualization: Describes a broader historical context relevant to the prompt.

This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or a reference.  To earn the point, the response must accurately describe a context relevant to how ideas of self-government influenced American colonial reaction to British imperial authority in the period from 1754 to 1776. Examples of context might include the following, with appropriate elaboration: • Mayflower Compact and/or acknowledgment of first chartered colonies • Enlightenment ideas about liberty and consent in government • Colonial experience with local control of  religious institutions (e.g., Congregationalist church) • Salutary neglect / Limited enforcement of the Navigation Acts (1651, 1660, and 1663)  Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) C: Evidence (0–2) Evidence: Provides specific examples of Examples of evidence used might include: • Virginia House of Burgesses (1 point) evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt. • Mayflower Compact • Albany Congress (1754) • Seven Years’ War (French and Indian War), To earn the first point, the response must identify specific historical examples of 1754–1763 • Pontiac’s Rebellion (1763) evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt. • Royal Proclamation of 1763 • Virtual representation OR • Sons of Liberty (Massachusetts) Supports an Argument: Supports an • Nonimportation/nonconsumption argument in response to the prompt using • Quartering Act (1765) specific and relevant examples of evidence. • Vice admiralty courts (2 points) • Stamp Act and protests (1765–1766) • Stamp Act Congress To earn the second point, the response must • “No taxation without representation” • Townshend Act (1767) use specific historical evidence to support an • Boston Massacre (1770) argument in response to the prompt. • Tea Act (1773) • Boston Tea Party (1773) • Coercive/Intolerable Acts (1773) • First and Second Continental Congress • Olive Branch Petition (1775) • Thomas Paine, Common Sense (1776) • Declaration of Independence (1776) Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) D: Analysis and Reasoning (0–2)  Historical Reasoning: Uses historical reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, continuity and change over time) to frame or structure an argument that addresses the prompt. (1 point) To earn the first point, the response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument, although the reasoning might be uneven or imbalanced. OR Complexity: Demonstrates a complex understanding of the historical development that is the focus of the prompt, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the question.

This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference. To earn the point, the response must accurately describe a context relevant to how ideas of self-government influenced American colonial reaction to British imperial authority from 1754 to 1776. Examples might include the following, with appropriate elaboration: • Mayflower Compact and/or acknowledgment of first chartered colonies. • Enlightenment ideas about liberty and consent in government. • Colonial experience with local control of religious institutions (e.g., Congregationalist church). • Salutary neglect/limited enforcement of the Navigation Acts (1651, 1660, and 1663). • Colonists’ beliefs that they had rights to English liberty and representation. • The Glorious Revolution (1688) demonstrated an unpopular monarch could be deposed. • Debt from French and Indian War (Seven Years’ War) led to increased economic regulations. • The Constitution embodied ideas about self-rule and liberty. Examples of acceptable contextualization: • “In the period before the French and Indian War, the colonies enjoyed a great amount of economic, political, and social freedom and even had a government as laid out in the Mayflower Compact. Before the war, there were Navigation Acts that required the colonies only trade with Britain, but they were not strictly enforced. Because of these freedoms, it was never heard of that the colonies were seeking independence or self-government.” (The response earned 1 point for contextualization because it describes broader historical patterns prior to the time period that established a predisposition to self-government among the British North American colonies.) • “The ideas of self-rule originally came from the Enlightenment movement. Notable figures such as John Locke and Thomas Hobbes came up with ideas of liberty and the people ruling their own government.” (The response earned 1 point for contextualization because it describes the intellectual movements that created a foundation for ideas about self-government in British North American colonies.) Example of unacceptable contextualization: • “In 1754 the British colonies have expanded along the east coast and have begun their own political system of government but were still under control from the monarchy of Great Britain.” (The response did not earn the point for contextualization because it is too broad.) Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) C. Evidence (0–2 points) Evidence Responses earn 1 point by providing at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt. Responses can earn this point without earning the point for a thesis statement. These examples of evidence must be different from the information used to earn the point for contextualization. Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument, or a significant portion of it, in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence will typically be more specific information. Examples of evidence used might include: • Virginia House of Burgesses • Mayflower Compact • New England town meetings • Fundamental Orders of Connecticut • Colonial charters • English liberties • British constitution • Albany Congress (1754) • Seven Years’ War (French and Indian War), 1754–1763 • Pontiac’s Rebellion (1763) • Royal Proclamation of 1763 • Virtual representation • Sons of Liberty (Massachusetts) • First and Second Continental Congress • State constitution making • Committees of safety • Committees of correspondence • Nonimportation/nonconsumption • Quartering Act (1765) • Vice admiralty courts • The Declaration of Rights and Grievances (1765) • Stamp Act and protests (1765–1766) • Stamp Act Congress • “No taxation without representation” • Declaratory Act (1766) — authority to pass any law regulating colonies “in all cases whatsoever” • Townshend Act (1767) • Boston Massacre (1770) • Tea Act (1773) — British East India Co. can sell to colonies without tax • Boston Tea Party (1773) • Coercive/Intolerable Acts (1773) • First and Second Continental Congress • Olive Branch Petition (1775) • Thomas Paine, Common Sense (1776) • Declaration of Independence (1776) Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) Example of acceptably providing evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt: • “The British parliament began to tax goods without the knowledge/consent of the colonists. Political figures began to write documents and pamphlets such as Thomas Paine’s ‘Common Sense.’” (The response earned 1 point for evidence. This example correctly identifies the idea of “no taxation without representation” and Thomas Paine’s pamphlet. It did not earn the second evidence point because the response does not clearly connect the evidence to an argument about self-government.) Examples of unacceptably providing evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt: • “During the 1754’s to 1776’s, America had been left on its own to self govern themselves and was given an opportunity to establish its own government.” (This example did not earn points for evidence as it confuses the prompt’s time period with salutary neglect.) • “The Crown was putting a massive tax on the smallest things.” (This example did not earn points for evidence because it is too broad and vague. More specificity about the kinds of goods taxed and/or the name of the tax act is necessary to earn this point.) OR Supports an Argument Responses earn 2 points if they support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant examples of evidence. Example of acceptable use of evidence to support an argument: • “The Stamp Act was the first direct tax on the colonists that they really noticed. The colonists responded to this with the proclamation of ‘No taxation without Representation,’ the argument that they could not be taxed if they weren’t represented in Parliament.” (The response earned 2 points for evidence. It correctly identifies examples in the form of the Stamp Act, which is then used to develop the larger argument about the relationship between ideas of self-government as a response to British imperial authority.) Example of unacceptable use of evidence to support an argument: • “The Boston Tea Party is one significant and influential example about the backlash against the British tea act. Crates of British tea was dumped by the Sons of Liberty, who were activists against tax collectors.” (The response earned 1 point for providing evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt. This response did not earn a second evidence point because the Boston Tea Party is not directly connected back to an argument in response to the prompt.) Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points) Historical Reasoning Responses earn 1 point by using historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument that addresses the prompt. To earn this point, the response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument, although the reasoning might be uneven or imbalanced. Examples of using historical reasoning might include: • Explaining how particular ideas from the Enlightenment helped cause American resistance to British rule, such as the Stamp Act protests or the Boston Tea Party • Tracing the continuity of earlier institutions of self-government such as the Virginia House of Burgesses to the role of local governing bodies in colonial protests, such as committees of correspondence Examples of acceptable use of historical reasoning: • “The Boston Tea Party was a protest where colonists dumped British tea into Boston harbor to go against the burdensome tea tax that Parliament imposed. In response, Britain seized the port, shut down the Massachusetts legislature, and replaced the former, elected officials with unelected bureaucrats from England.” (The response earned 1 point for historical reasoning because it demonstrates causation. It did not earn an additional point for complexity as the response did not corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument.) • “These ideas of self-government created a stirring in them that first questioned, then resented, then sought to change their reality.” (The response earned 1 point for historical reasoning for demonstrating change over time. This theme carries throughout the essay, culminating with this statement. The response did not earn an additional point for complexity as it did not corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument.) Examples of unacceptable use of historical reasoning: • “Thomas Paine’s ‘Common Sense’ talks about the idea of being free from a ruler and living in a balanced society. This gave way to the American revolution with the goal of having a government for the people, by the people.” (This example did not earn a point for historical reasoning. The response attempts to demonstrate causation, that Thomas Paine’s writings “gave way” to the American Revolution. This connection is not fully developed and is not directly related to ideas of self-government, which is the focus of the prompt.) • “Americans might have been the British if we hadn’t wanted self government so badly. Luckily the Brits made it clear by demanding their money they chose to spend, inflicted a series of radical tax prices on our largest imports. At that point it would sound nice to be on your own because Britain was just taking it too far and temptation to self-government prevailed.” (This example did not earn a point for historical reasoning. The response attempts to demonstrate causation or change over time, but it lacks specifics to structure an argument that addresses the prompt.) Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) OR Complexity Responses earn 2 points for demonstrating a complex understanding of the topic, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify that argument. Demonstrating complex understanding might include: • Explaining a nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables by, for example, assessing how ideas of self-government played out in different colonies such as Virginia and Massachusetts • Explaining multiple causes of American resistance to British colonial authority, such as the development of a unique American identity • Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across periods by, for example, making comparisons with arguments over federalism in the 1780s and 1790s or states’ rights in the 1850s or 1960s • Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes by, for example, exploring cultural ideas about British American exceptionalism or the socioeconomic differences of British American societies from Great Britain • Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence by, for example, examining the reasons why colonial resistance against the Navigation Acts and British imperial supervision before the 1760s was limited compared to the colonial reaction against the exertion of British imperial authority after 1763 This understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference. Examples of acceptable demonstration of a complex complex understanding: • The following response earned the point for complexity. While the essay acknowledges the central role self-government played in leading to revolution, this example identifies that not all colonists (like the Quakers) adhered to these ideas. This qualifies the response’s overall argument by highlighting specific demographic groups that did not necessarily support self-government. The response demonstrates a complex understanding of the topic. “However, despite the mass colonial patriotism, some colonists were unaffected by ideas of self-governance. Most notable among these is anti-war Pennsylvania Representative John Dickinson, a Quaker. He, rather than voting to declare independence and go to war, pushes through the Olive Branch Petition, which was an attempt to reconcile with Britain.” • The following response earned the point for complexity. The response recognizes that debates regarding self-governance continued well after the end of the war by including references to continued arguments over federalism (Federalists and Anti-Federalists). This corroborates the original argument by explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across time periods. The response demonstrates a complex understanding that the question of self-governance was not settled by the American Revolution. “After winning independence from Britain at the battle of Yorktown and the signing of the Treaty of Paris, debates with the intent of protecting self-governance still ensued. Examples such as the debates between the Federalists and Anti-Federalists over the self-governance of states embodied the lasting desires that were born on this continent so many centuries ago.” Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) • The following response earned the point for complexity. The essay argues that while not all colonists initially viewed British imperial tendencies as immoral on their own, an increasing desire for expanded democracy and self-governance fueled the American Revolution. It identifies the reasons why resistance to the Navigation Acts was limited in comparison to later taxes such as the Stamp Act. This corroborates the original argument by showing similarities and differences over time. The response demonstrates a complex understanding of the topic. “Prior to the American Revolution, taxes from Britain were not foreign to the colonists. Import duties paid to the Crown and restrictions on trade through the Navigation Acts had been commonplace. Import duties, however, had been an external tax; they were not paid directly by individuals, but rather by businesses at the port. The Stamp Act of 1754 did not follow this precedent of external taxes from Britain. As an internal tax, the Act demanded extra payment on not just stamps, but papers and other items as well.” • The following response earned the point for complexity. The essay argues that the American Revolution did not occur because of a great desire for self-government. Rather, the response contends, revolution was inspired by mercantilism. The response provides evidence throughout of colonial rebellions in response to excessive taxation and economic hardships. This modifies the original prompt by acknowledging the minor role of self-government in fomenting rebellion. The response demonstrates a complex understanding of the topic. o “Concepts of self-government had some influence on American reactions to the British. However, the philosophy of mercantilism was the major influence on the American’s Declaration of Independence. Ideas of self-government had little effect on American resistance to the British.” o “Conversely, the British use of mercantilism against the colonists was the major influence for the American colonial reaction. Rebellions occurred in response to the British economic policies such as the Boston Tea Party. By dumping an entire shipment of tea into Boston Harbor, the residents of Boston defied the British because of their disturbance of the American economy, not Americas’ ideas of self-government.” Examples of unacceptable demonstration of a complex understanding: • The following example did not earn the complexity point. The response attempts to corroborate the argument by demonstrating how debates regarding self-government continued after the American Revolution. It provides evidence by referencing the sectional crisis in the 1850s; however, a brief reference is not sufficient to demonstrate a complex understanding of the topic. “The southern states tried breaking away in the same fashion in the time between 1850 and 1860, leading to the Civil War.” • The following example did not earn the complexity point. The response attempts to modify the topic by analyzing multiple issues, but it entirely dismisses the validity of the prompt itself and ignores earlier historical developments of self-government in the British North American colonies. The response makes no attempt to identify examples of ideas of self-government and therefore does not demonstrate a complex understanding of the time period. “The reactions of the colonists to the various acts of British imperial authority from 1756–1776 was never rooted out of the ideals for self-government. The idea of self-government only came at the offset of the war. The reactions of the colonists came more from wanting to be in the period of freedom that salutary neglect brought.” Question 3 — Long Essay Question Evaluate the extent to which debates over slavery in the period from 1830 to 1860 led the United States into the Civil War. Maximum Possible Points: 6 Points  Rubric  Notes  A: Thesis/Claim (0–1)  Thesis/Claim: Responds to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis/claim that establishes a line of reasoning. (1 point) To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt rather than restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion.  The thesis must make a historically defensible claim that establishes a line of reasoning about how debates over slavery in the period from 1830 to 1860 led the United States into the Civil War. Examples that earn this point include: • “Overall the debate of slavery had a tremendous impact on causing the Civil War as sectionalism and debates over state’s rights arised.” • “Although tangential debates over issues such as state vs. federal power may have contributed to the divide between the North and the South and thus the outlook of the Civil War, the primary cause of the Civil War was the tension over slavery.”  • “Throughout the mid-1800’s, debates rose on the institution of slavery which eventually led to the Civil War: social arguments were made such as whites were superior to blacks; the south argued that slaves were economically beneficial due to the stable labor force; and most importantly, political divisions between the North and the South greatly caused the Civil War.”  Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) Contextualization B: (0–1) Contextualization: Describes a broader historical context relevant to the prompt.

(1 point) To earn the first point, the response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument, although the reasoning might be uneven or imbalanced. OR Complexity: Demonstrates a complex understanding of the historical development that is the focus of the prompt, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the question. (2 points) To earn the second point, the response must demonstrate a complex understanding. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways, such as: • Explaining a nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables • Explaining both similarity and difference, or explaining both continuity and change, or explaining multiple causes, or explaining both causes and  Examples of using historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument might include: • Explaining how the activism of abolitionists and policies of the Republican Party helped cause increased tensions between the North and the South • Tracing the long-term continuity/change in debates over the spread of the institution of slavery to the West from the 1830s to 1860 • Developing the similarities/differences between Northern industrialization and Southern plantation agriculture OR Ways of demonstrating a complex understanding of this prompt might include the following: • Explaining a nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables by, for example, assessing different arguments against slavery and different proposals for what to do about it • Explaining both short-and long-term causes by, for example, addressing the immediate effects of antislavery activism in the 1830s and long-term effects by the late 1850s • Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across periods by, for example, comparing proslavery arguments from the 1830s to 1860 with arguments about Jim Crow from the 1880s to  effects • Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across periods • Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes • Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence This understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference.  the 1900s • Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes, for example, by considering Northerners’ and Southerners’ cultural notions about their unique regional identities • Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence by, for example, arguing convincingly with evidence that debates over slavery were secondary to debates about state sovereignty in the outbreak of the Civil War  If response is completely blank, enter --for all four score categories: A, B, C, and D.  Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) Scoring Notes Introductory notes: • Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently, e.g., a student could earn a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim. • Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. • Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 point) Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible claim that establishes a line of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion. Examples of acceptable theses: • “In general, the hostilities were worsened through events like the Compromise of 1850, the Kansas-Nebraska Act, and Bleeding Kansas until a breaking point with the election of President Lincoln that led to southern secession and war.” (The response makes a claim in response to the prompt and suggests an evaluative line of argument development.) • “The issue of slavery therefore did help lead to the Civil War, which is evident with the Compromise of 1850 and the Kansas-Nebraska issue, but it was not the sole reason for the war’s outbreak, for economic and sectional differences were a big factor as well.” (The response makes a claim in response to the prompt and establishes the analytic categories for the argument.) Example of unacceptable theses: • “Throughout our history, the US has grown and grown, expanded and expanded. Our culture tends to move with us as we go, but when the movement and expansion of slavery came into question, numerous issues arose.” (This response attempts to establish a defensible line of reasoning, but it is vague.) • “Throughout the time period of 1830 until 1860 debate over slavery was the main issue in American civilization.” (This response largely restates the prompt.) Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) B. Contextualization (0–1 point) Responses earn 1 point by describing a broader historical context relevant to the topic of the prompt. To earn this point, the response must accurately and explicitly connect the context of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that occurred before, during, or continued after the time frame of the question. This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference. To earn the point, the response must accurately describe a context relevant to how debates over slavery in the period from 1830 to 1860 led the United States into the Civil War. Examples might include the following, with appropriate elaboration: • Origins of slavery in the British colonial economy • Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions/Compact theory • The United States Constitution’s treatment of slavery • Ban on the international slave trade in 1808 • Britain banned the slave trade in 1807 and abolished slavery in its colonies in 1833 • Implications of the Missouri Compromise • Southern economic reliance on slavery • Cotton gin • Southern concerns about protectionist trade policies, rebellions by enslaved people, and propaganda • The Civil War (1861–1865) • Debates over states’ rights after the Civil War • Sharecropping in the South • Reconstruction • Black Codes/Jim Crow • Populism • World War I and World War II Example of acceptable contextualization: • “….the political and economic status of slaves during the debates over slavery didn’t change the reality of lives for blacks after the Civil War. Southerners still argued for control over the Black population through the Black Codes and Jim Crow laws.” (The response earned 1 point for contextualization because it establishes a historical pattern that relates to the main idea of the prompt.) Example of unacceptable contextualization: • “Throughout the nineteenth century the economies of the North and the South became increasingly different.” (While the response has the potential to provide underlying context to the prompt, it does not provide a clear explanation of what caused the economic differences nor how those changes relate to debates over slavery.) C. Evidence (0–2 points) Evidence Responses earn 1 point by providing at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt. Responses can earn this point without earning the point for a thesis statement. Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) These examples of evidence must be different from the information used to earn the point for contextualization. Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument, or a significant portion of it, in a broader context.

Calhoun • Filibusters Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) Example of acceptably providing evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt: • “The passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act overturned previous precedent prohibiting the expansion of slavery north of 36’30”, and allowed the inhabitants of a territory to decide whether or not to permit slavery.” (The response earned 1 point by citing evidence relevant to the topic, but it does not use that evidence to support an argument in response to the prompt, so it did not earn the second point.) Example of unacceptably providing evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt: • “During the period of 1830–1860, the United States government passed legislation such as the 3/5 Compromise, the Alien and Sedition Act, and the Missouri Compromise to calm the slavery issue.” (The response did not earn the point because the evidence presented is not directly relevant to the issues of slavery and the beginning of the Civil War, nor is it from the period.) OR Supports an Argument Responses earn 2 points if they support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant examples of evidence. Example of acceptable use of evidence to support an argument: • “Radical abolitionists such as John Brown attempted to challenge slavery by arming enslaved people against slaveholders. Although Brown was unsuccessful, Southern leaders used calls by abolitionists to end slavery as a justification for threatening secession if antislavery laws were passed.” (The response earned 1 point for historical evidence and 1 point for supporting an argument because it establishes a specific historical example as contributing to the outbreak of the Civil War.) Example of unacceptable use of evidence to support an argument: • “Cotton production rapidly increased throughout the nineteenth century as a result of increased demand for textiles, and new technologies made growing cotton more profitable in regions with slaves.” (The response cites evidence relevant to the topic, which would count for the first evidence point, but it does not use that evidence to support an argument about the relationship between debates over slavery and the origin of the Civil War.) D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points) Historical Reasoning Responses earn 1 point by using historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument that addresses the prompt. To earn this point, the response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument, although the reasoning might be uneven or imbalanced. Examples of using historical reasoning might include: • Explaining how the activism of abolitionists and policies of the Republican Party helped cause increased tensions between the North and the South • Tracing the long-term continuity/change in debates over the spread of the institution of slavery to the West from the 1830s to 1860 • Developing the similarities/differences between Northern industrialization and Southern plantation agriculture Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) Example of acceptable use of historical reasoning: • “Although the movement was largely unsuccessful and was focused on issues of trade and taxation, the Nullification Crisis set the stage for later proslavery arguments. Those in favor of nullification argued that states had the right to override federal laws, and Southern states in particular argued that they could disregard any laws placing limitations on the rights of slaveholders.” (The response earned 1 point because it connects the continuation of broader ideas behind nullification to the specific arguments regarding slavery that contributed to Southern secession and the beginning of the Civil War.) Example of unacceptable use of historical reasoning: • “Uncle Tom’s cabin was so gruesom, graphic, and realistic that it shocked many northerners. Many people who read the book began to fight for the abolitionist movement.” (The response did not earn the point because it did not frame or structure any argument that addresses the topic of the prompt.) OR Complexity Responses earn 2 points for demonstrating a complex understanding of the topic, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify that argument. Demonstrating a complex understanding might include: • Explaining a nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables by, for example, assessing different arguments against slavery and different proposals for how to address it • Explaining both short-and long-term causes by, for example, addressing the immediate effects of antislavery activism in the 1830s and long-term effects seen by the late 1850s • Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across periods by, for example, comparing proslavery arguments from the 1830s to 1860 with arguments about Jim Crow from the 1880s to the 1900s • Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes, for example, by considering Northerners’ and Southerners’ cultural notions about their unique regional identities • Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence by, for example, arguing convincingly with evidence that debates over slavery were secondary to debates about state sovereignty in the outbreak of the Civil War This understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference. Examples of acceptable demonstration of a complex understanding: • The following response uses nuance to qualify the main thrust of the prompt, asserting that connections between the North and West also contributed to the Civil War. It makes an overall argument focused on westward expansion, but it shows complexity in arguing that northern industrialization was heavily reliant on that expansion and that an industrial North tied to the West threatened the South beyond the question of slavery. To support this argument, it uses evidence related to the more political aspects of westward expansion, such as the Kansas–Nebraska Act and the Lincoln–Douglas Debates, and evidence related to the more economic ties between the North and West, such as the Erie Canal and raw materials from the Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) West feeding the industrial factories of the North. “While slave disputes were a major cause that led the U.S. into the Civil War to some extent, it was also the fact that the North and West were becoming increasingly connected during the expansion westward, which set conditions for industrialization which the South saw as a threat to their economy.” • The following response modifies the prompt to address both slavery and the Civil War as the effects of existing sectionalism, rather than debates over slavery as the cause of the Civil War. It addresses the Mexican-American War, the Compromise of 1850, the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and the Lincoln–Douglas debates to support a nuanced argument. This consideration of alternative views demonstrates a complex understanding of historical developments from 1830 to 1860. “In essence, rather than the debates over slavery being the main cause of the Civil War, the main cause was that the North and South were already divided and slavery is just the result.” • The following essay argues that the differences in ideals and sectional interests, and the inability to compromise during this period, culminated in an irreversible divide. It identifies the reasons for sectionalism and for the change in the Northern goals in the Civil War, from preserving the Union to ending slavery. This corroborates the initial argument by demonstrating a causation relation, proving the thesis. “While issues such as tariffs that supported Northern manufacturing & hurt Southern economies played a role in creating sectional divide, it was slavery that truly led the United States into Civil War & the failing of several compromises; many problems that divided the North & South were revolved around slavery such as the Fugitive Slave Act & Dred Scott Decision, & with the election of republican Abraham Lincoln, the issues culminated into the secession of the South.” The essay continues, “The debate would eventually drive the union’s motive for the war, as Lincoln’s Gettysburg address would shift the focus of the war from unification to emancipating African Americans from the moral evils of slavery. This would be crucial, as the South would lose support from Britain & Europe as they did not want to support an immoral cause. Overall, the difference in ideals, sectional interests & inability to compromise during this period culminated in an irreversible divide between North & South and our nation’s only Civil War.” Example of unacceptable demonstration of a complex understanding: • The following response does not demonstrate a complex understanding. It attempts unsuccessfully to link several events across time periods on a theme of inequality. Ultimately, the chronological confusion and lack of relevant elaboration fail to make the connection. “In the case Plessy vs Ferguson, it was upheld that segregation was constitutional, which only added to heinous government decisions like the Three Fifths compromise, which only counted every 3 out of 5 slaves as human beings. This inequality angered many people, as they argued that every man is equal, as demonstrated in the Declaration of Independence. The neglect of egalitarianism seemed unconstitutional, but no one with government power bothered to make any changes.” Question 4 — Long Essay Question Evaluate the extent to which ideas about democracy contributed to the African American Civil Rights movement in the period from 1940 to 1970. Maximum Possible Points: 6 Points  Rubric  Notes  A: Thesis/Claim (0–1)  Thesis/Claim: Responds to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis/claim that establishes a line of reasoning.

Given the timed nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. • Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 point) Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible claim that establishes a line of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion. Examples of acceptable theses: • “The ideas about democracy such as the notion that everyone should be treated equally and the rights to assemble and petition greatly contributed to the African American Civil Rights movement from 1940–1970.” (The response makes an evaluative and historically defensible claim that addresses the prompt and establishes a line of reasoning.) • “From 1940 to 1970, many ideas of democracy and equality were all a part to give way to equity during the Civil Rights movement, through the ideas that separate is not equal, voting rights, and tackling racism through non-violence & Black Power.” (The response makes a historically defensible claim that addresses the prompt, identifies categories of analysis, and establishes a line of reasoning.) Example of unacceptable theses: • “Ideas on democracy had a large impact on the African American Civil Rights movement.” (This example largely restates the prompt. While it provides an evaluative adjective, the response does not establish a historically defensible claim.) • “During the latter part of the 1900s democracy and what side was correct led to or contributed to African American Civil Rights movement in the sense that it allowed for or encouraged individuals to fight for what he or she desires.” (The response is too vague to make a historically defensible claim.) Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) B. Contextualization (0–1 point) Responses earn 1 point by describing a broader historical context relevant to the topic of the prompt. To earn this point, the response must accurately and explicitly connect the context of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that occurred before, during, or continued after the time frame of the question. This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference. To earn the point, the response must accurately describe a context relevant to how ideas about democracy contributed to the African American Civil Rights movement from 1940 to 1970. Examples might include the following, with appropriate elaboration: • Earlier African American activism for greater rights and against vigilante violence between the 1910s and 1930s (beginning of what some scholars called a “long Civil Rights movement”) • African American movement to urban areas in the North and West during the Great Migration • African American participation in World War II • Decolonization in Africa and Asia after World War II • Cold War competition with the Soviet Union to win allies and to present the United States as a model society Example of acceptable contextualization: • “The 13th Amendment abolished slavery, the 14th Amendment made everyone born in the US a citizen and granted all citizens equal protection under the law, and the 15th Amendment gave all male citizens the right to vote. However, things like the Plessy v. Ferguson ruling, which ruled ‘separate but equal’ constitutional, Jim Crow laws, and literacy tests and poll taxes limited democratic rights of African Americans for almost 100 years after the Civil War. … Black Americans’ democratic right of equal protection under the law, constituted by the 14th Amendment was being infringed upon, and thus democracy was not being carried out to its fullest potential.” (The response earned 1 point by describing the broader historical context of Reconstruction-era Supreme Court decisions and Jim Crow segregation, which are relevant to the topic of the prompt.) Example of unacceptable contextualization: • “Through the span of a few centuries they would slowly gain, lose, regain and fight for freedom, liberty, and independence that was supposed to be promised to them.” (The response did not earn a point because while it indicates an extremely general historical context for the African American Civil Rights movement, that African Americans experienced gains and losses in terms of freedom over “a few centuries,” it does not provide any detail about the context, nor does it relate the context to ideas of democracy described in the prompt.) C. Evidence (0–2 points) Evidence Responses earn 1 point by providing at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt. Responses can earn this point without earning the point for a thesis statement. These examples of evidence must be different from the information used to earn the point for contextualization. Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument, or a significant portion of it, in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence will typically be more specific information. Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) Examples of evidence used might include: Groups: • Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) • National Organization for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) • Southern Christian Leadership Committee (SCLC) • Student Non-Violent Coordinating Conference (SNCC) • Black Panthers • Nation of Islam • Dixiecrats • Tuskegee Airmen People: • John L.

It was led by Martin Luther King. The people that attended were people of all races. That was also the day he gave his speech. Their was also two groups (SCLC, SNCC) that did nonviolent protest during the Civil Rights movement.” (The example cites evidence relevant to the topic, so it earned 1 evidence point, but it does not use that evidence to support an argument in response to the prompt.) Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) Example of unacceptably providing evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt • “In addition, there were protests against white owners for mistreating the African American slaves. Martin Luther King was also part of the abolitionists. He was the tongue of all African Americans who can’t speak because of fear.” (The response did not earn the point for historical evidence because of the major error that places MLK in the abolitionist movement.) OR Supports an Argument Responses earn 2 points if they support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant examples of evidence. Example of acceptable use of evidence to support an argument: • “Activist organizations like the NAACP, Student Non-Violent Coordiance Committee, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference sought to challenge civil acceptance of racial terror through nonviolent organizing. … Organizations like the Black Panther Party in the late 60s used principles of communal organization and violent means if necessary in order to imagine a new version of democracy that challenged even the most progressive approaches to racial justice.” (The response earned 2 points for evidence because it uses various civil rights and Black liberation organizations and connects them to the larger movement of democratic reforms called for by the Civil Rights movement.) Example of unacceptable use of evidence to support an argument: • “The Black Panther and National Association for the Advancement of Colored People greatly believed in uplifting descendants from the African community through means of western and cultural education.” (This example cites evidence relevant to the topic, so it could receive the first evidence point, but it does not use that evidence to support an argument in response to the prompt.) D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points) Historical Reasoning Responses earn 1 point by using historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument that addresses the prompt. To earn this point, the response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument, although the reasoning might be uneven or imbalanced. Examples of using historical reasoning might include: • Explaining how protests for voting rights such as the Selma march helped cause concrete changes in the law and voting practices • Explaining continuity by tracing the long-term strategies pursued by civil rights activists to oppose and end segregation Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) Example of acceptable use of historical reasoning: • “Another important democratic idea to the Civil Rights movement was the right to free speech, ideas, and protest. When African American Rosa Parks was arrested for not moving to the back (segregated) part of the bus, it spurred anger amongst the black community. This quickly led to the Montgomery Bus Boycott, where the black community spoke out against segregated buses and refused to ride them. This greatly impacted bus business. Similarly, the Greensboro sit-ins protested segregation at eating facilities when a group of black citizens sat at a white table in a restaurant. Both of these protests were inspired by the democratic idea to speak freely against problems in society.” (This example earned 1 point for historical reasoning because it uses causation to frame an argument that addresses the prompt.) • “During the period of time lots of things started to change. The government was desegregated along with schools, buses, & the military. … Another reason the ideas about democracy contributed to the African American Civil Rights movement to a major extent is because today we see de jure segregation is gone.” (This example earned 1 point for historical reasoning because it structures an argument using change over time.) Example of unacceptable use of historical reasoning: • “All they were trying to do was get their education, so what they did was stand up and protest for their civil rights to get an education and they achieved it but democracy played a role because of the votes of the American people.” (The response did not earn the point for historical reasoning because the argument is too vague.) OR Complexity Responses earn 2 points for demonstrating a complex understanding of the topic, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify that argument. Demonstrating a complex understanding might include: • Explaining a nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables by, for example, assessing how ideas of democracy in the Civil Rights movement differed in the North and in the South • Explaining both short-and long-term causes by, for example, addressing the immediate causes of the Brown decision and analyzing how the outcome of the decision evolved over subsequent decades • Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across periods by, for example, making comparisons with the Reconstruction era • Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes by, for example, considering how foreign relations during the Cold War affected how the United States government responded to the Civil Rights movement • Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence by, for example, considering how ideas about Black nationalism and anti-imperialism influenced leaders of the Civil Rights movement This understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference. Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) Examples of acceptable demonstration of a complex understanding: • The following response earned the point for complexity. The response argues that the pursuit of economic equality and prosperity are democratic values, and they are driving forces in the African American Civil Rights movement. This corroborates the original argument by explaining relevant, insightful connections within and across themes. The response demonstrates a complex understanding that ideas about democracy also extend to economic issues within the larger Civil Rights movement. “Finally, the limits on the economic prosperity attained by blacks was limited. With the rise of Levittowns in the 1950s, many whites fled areas that were being filled with black populations to these suburbs. De facto segrigation led to no one selling houses to black individuals. This caused major economic desperitties and backlash from colored individuals. After 1965, the shift in civil rights was economic based. Many African Americans still worked low skilled jobs and in agriculture. Higher paying jobs were given to white individuals and left African Americans to suffer in poverty.” • The following response earned the point for complexity. This response argues that civil rights organizers often worked to subvert popular notions of democracy in order to achieve what they believed was just. This modifies the original prompt by highlighting specific individuals, court cases, and organizations that diversified approaches to civil rights through alternative definitions of democratic principles. This response demonstrates a complex understanding of the topic. “Despite brutal harassment, murder, surveillance, and assault, the inter-linkages between this movement and the antiwar movements, created a full-court press on the ideological assumptions that ‘all men are created equal,’ and had empirical success. The drafting of the Civil Rights bill in 1964, Brown v. Board of 1964, Loving v. Virginia decision in 1967, and integration of black political figures into the polity were all direct results of the black civil rights organizers, planners, organizations, and principles that sought to undercut normative conceptions of democracy and conjure up new black liberation.” • The following response earned the point for complexity. While the response acknowledges the role that ideas about democracy play in the African American Civil Rights movement, this response identifies that not all leaders of the movement (such as Malcolm X) embraced democratic principles as a source of inspiration. This qualifies the response’s overall argument by highlighting specific global revolutions that did not necessarily embrace American notions of democracy. This response demonstrates a complex understanding of the topic. “Malcolm X certainly espoused ideas encouraging further divisions in American society. As part of the ‘black power’ movement, Malcolm X cited a rich African American heritage to encourage the formation of an independent state. Furthermore, Malcolm X referenced a drive for democracy in several surrounding nations where an oppressed group rose up against there colonial overlords, notably the earlier slave revolt in Haiti as well as the independence of previously colonized Latin American and African nations. He used this emergence of democracy in other nations to encourage African Americans to form an independent nation-state away from the confines of white society. Thus Malcolm X’s black power movement, drawing on earlier leaders like Marcus Garvey stressed a separate nation for African Americans by referencing democratic principles in other nations. Most African American Civil Rights activists, however, focused on American principles of democracy to ensure they remained united.” Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) Example of unacceptable demonstration of a complex understanding: • This example did not earn the complexity point. The response attempts to qualify the argument by indicating that civil rights activism cannot take place outside of democracy. The response makes no attempt to identify examples of ideas of democracy and therefore does not demonstrate a complex understanding of the time period. “In conclusion, the way democracy worked in the late 1900s, affected what events occured, thus the Civil Rights movement occured. Although wanting to be seen as equals, African Americans would not have acted if not for the democracy then.”
