cult of domesticity. • Transition to a wage-based economy. • Expansion of infrastructure and national economic network through national roads and canals (e.g., Erie Canal).  • Early textile manufacturing; Lowell Mills; republican industrialization. • Innovations in interchangeable parts (e.g., Eli Whitney, gun manufacturing).  • Fewer people worked in subsistence agriculture.  • More manufacturing of goods occurred in factories rather than the home, but combined with ongoing significance of putting out system/cottage industries. • Use of early steamboats to transport people and goods.   Civil War era in the middle of the 1800s • The Civil War ended slavery and set the nation on the course to become an industrial society. • Shift from the dominance of cotton and agrarianism to dominance of industry. • Transportation innovations (especially railroads) during and after the war linked markets together by making the movement of goods and people easier and quicker.  • Manufacturing of weapons and armaments during the war advanced interchangeable parts.   Short Answer Question 4 (continued)  • Use of telegraph during and after the war; building of national telegraph network that followed the rail lines. • Steam engines, interchangeable parts made large scale manufacturing more efficient.  • Increased foreign investment in capital projects, infrastructure, and manufacturing as a result of the war, continued after the war.  Rise of big business in the second half of the 1800s • Combinations allowed for exponential growth of capital and investment, purchase of equipment needed for large-scale industrial enterprise. • Horizontal and vertical integration and economies of scale allowed for mass production. • Technological innovations such as more efficient use of coal and steam engines, Bessemer process (steel), application of electricity as an energy and power source. • Large factories and corporations provided more semiskilled and unskilled work. • More Americans became wage-earners in the industrial economy and consumers in the industrial and consumer capital marketplace. • Growth of national consumer market, catalogs, mail order, advertising. • Calls for regulation of monopolies and trusts in response to the growing influence of corporations. • Rise of the People’s Party (Populist Party). • Rise of the labor movement. • Industrialization impacted the economic livelihood of farmers and transformed farming.  • Demands for a stronger government role in the economic system.   c) Response provides specific historical evidence that explains why ONE of the other options is less convincing as the possible beginning of industrialization in the United States.  The market revolution • The market revolution was not a real revolution. Instead, it continued trends in the rise of industry from the late 1700s and from Europe; the United States already had a market economy.  Civil War era • The real transition was the market revolution, while the Civil War era represented continuation of trends from earlier in the 1800s; interchangeable parts and railroads were put into more widespread use, but were not new. • The United States still had not become truly industrial without the rise of heavy industries such as steel manufacturing, which would happen after the Civil War.  Rise of big business • The real transition was earlier, and the rise of big business mainly continued this; key elements such as organizational innovation existed earlier.    Question 1 — Document-Based Question  Explain the reasons why a new conservatism rose to prominence in the United States between 1960 and 1989.  A.

I am here concerned . . . by the unmistakable tendency of the   Republican Party to adopt the same course. The result is that today neither of our two parties   maintains a meaningful commitment to the principle of States’ Rights. Thus, the cornerstone of the   Republic, our chief bulwark against the encroachment of individual freedom by Big Government, is   fast disappearing under the piling sands of absolutism. . . .     The root evil is that the government is engaged in activities in which it has no legitimate business.   As long as the federal government acknowledges responsibility in a given social or economic field,   its spending in that field cannot be substantially reduced.   Components of document analysis may include, but are not limited to, the following:  • Intended audience: fellow conservatives; the voting public • Purpose: to advocate for a smaller federal government and to defend states’ rights to make decisions for themselves at a time when the federal government was expanding its authority; criticizing the expansion of unwarranted governmental powers; also, to make a case for his upcoming campaign for the presidency • Historical context: written during a time of expanding federal power. In particular, federal power was increasingly being used to protect the civil rights of African Americans, and arguments for states’ rights were used as defenses of racial segregation • The author’s point of view: conservative politician; an advocate of states’ rights and limited federal power     Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Document 2      Source: Milton Friedman, economist, Capitalism and Freedom, 1962.     We now have several decades of experience with governmental intervention. . . .     Which if any of the great “reforms” of past decades has achieved its objectives? . . .     A housing program intended to improve the housing conditions of the poor, to reduce juvenile   delinquency, and to contribute to the removal of urban slums, has worsened the housing conditions   of the poor, contributed to juvenile delinquency, and spread urban blight. . . .     The greater part of the new ventures undertaken by government in the past few decades have failed    to achieve their objectives. The United States has continued to progress; its citizens have become   better fed, better clothed, better housed, and better transported; class and social distinctions have   narrowed; minority groups have become less disadvantaged. . . . All this has been the product of the   initiative and drive of individuals co-operating through the free market.    Components of document analysis may include the following:  • Intended audience: fellow conservatives; economists; the reading public • Purpose: to critique government programs to support the economy and to advocate for free-market economics, supply-side economics, and trickle-down theory • Historical context: written after three decades of the relative dominance of the New Deal political order, which established a variety of government programs to support individuals and to regulate economy; offers alternative way to regulate the economy through the money supply; challenges Keynesian economics • The author’s point of view: conservative economist; advocate of free market policies; intends to criticize government economic programs and to argue that economic gains of the 20th century came from free markets    Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Document 3    Source: Letter to Nelson Rockefeller, Republican governor of New York, February 6, 1971.    This letter is written to you by a law abiding citizen who feels she is discriminated against in favor of  dope addicts and welfare cheats.

My typewriter was stolen.   Components of document analysis may include the following:  • Intended audience: New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller; political leaders who may be able to help • Purpose: to request government assistance against problems for urban danger; to criticize perceived permissive liberal policies that favor lawbreakers and the perceived failure of the liberal state • Historical context: long-term increase in crime that accelerated in the late 1960s and early 1970s; urban unrest of late 1960s; changes in inner cities; possibly racial transition of cities as “white flight” led an increasingly African American population to move in; conservative politicians’ call for law and order • The author’s point of view: claims to be a law-abiding female widow afraid to leave her home; blames drug addicts and welfare cheats for urban problems and crime; adopts language of being discriminated against to describe position    Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Document 4     Source: Jerry Falwell, television evangelist and founder of the Moral Majority, Listen, America!,    1980.    We must reverse the trend America finds herself in today. Young people between the ages of     twenty-five and forty have been born and reared in a different world than Americans of years past.   The television set has been their primary baby-sitter. From the television set they have learned   situation ethics and immorality—they have learned a loss of respect for human life. They have    learned to disrespect the family as God has established it. They have been educated in a public-   school system that is permeated with secular humanism. They have been taught that the Bible is   just another book of literature. They have been taught that there are no absolutes in our world    today. They have been introduced to the drug culture. They have been reared by the family and    the public school in a society that is greatly void of discipline and character-building. These same   young people have been reared under the influence of a government that has taught them   socialism and welfarism. They have been taught to believe that the world owes them a living   whether they work or not.      From AMERICA: A NARRATIVE HISTORY, SEVENTH EDITION by George Brown Tindall and David E. Shi.

This philosophy     once occupied a hallowed place in American diplomacy, but it was casually . . . dismissed at the   outset by the Carter Administration—and the results have been shattering. Never before in modern   history has the United States endured as many humiliations, insults, and defeats as it has during    the past four years: our ambassadors murdered, our embassies burned, our warnings ignored, our   diplomacy scorned, our diplomats kidnapped. The Carter Administration has shown that it neither   understands totalitarianism nor appreciates the way tyrants take advantage of weakness. The brutal   invasion of Afghanistan promises to be only the forerunner of much more serious threats to the   West—and to world peace—should the Carter Administration somehow cling to power.    Components of document analysis may include the following:  • Intended audience: Republican Party members; the voting public; the news media • Purpose: to advocate U.S. strength in the world; to criticize the Carter administration’s foreign policy • Historical context: Ronald Reagan’s 1980 presidential campaign against Jimmy Carter on the heels of the Iranian hostage crisis • The author’s point of view: critical of Carter administration; supportive of vigorous projection of         U.S. power in the world    Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  Document 6     Source: Teddi Holt, a homemaker, a member of Georgia Stop ERA, and the national president of Mothers   On the March, 1984.     I am pleased that God blessed me with the privilege of being a woman.

There’s no doubt that there has been discrimination   against women, but that is past history, just as discrimination against blacks is past history in the US . . .     Just what were we women to be liberated from? These women [feminists] were calling for liberation from    the things women like me love most—our husbands, our children, our homes. My cry became: “God,   liberate us from the Liberators!” . . .     We believe that the mothers of this and other nations must stand up for the protection of our homes and   our children. In no way are we extremists, unless we be guilty of extreme devotion to our husbands, our   children, and our homes. It is our sincere belief that if we do not unite against the threats to the home, if   we retire to the convenience and security of our houses and do not speak out, then it will not be long until   we, the “keeper at home” (Titus 2.5) will not have a home to keep!     Excerpt from “Women Who Do and Women Who Don’t Join the Women’s Movement” by Teddi Holt and edited by Robyn Rowland, Copyright ©   1984 by Teddi Holt.

These historical phenomena may include, but are not limited to, the following:  • Reactions against the perceived permissiveness of the 1960s and 1970s, including the counterculture, antiwar protest, feminism, and the sexual revolution • The ongoing thread of anticommunism in the post-World War II U.S. • Reactions against the perceived excesses of government interventions in the economy and society, such as various welfare programs and the Johnson administration’s Great Society • Concerns about U.S. economic stagnation, combined with belief in free market solutions • Concerns about increased crime and the perceived need for greater law and order • Population movements out of cities into suburbs and out of the North and East into the South and West • Possible reactions against the successes of the Civil Rights movement • Reaction against Supreme Court rulings expanding the rights of the accused • Perceptions of military weakness following the Vietnam War and a desire to strengthen the U.S. military • Emergence of charismatic politicians such as Ronald Reagan  Synthesis  Responses can earn the point for synthesis by crafting a persuasive and coherent essay. This can be accomplished providing a conclusion that extends or modifies the analysis in the essay, by using disparate, and sometimes contradictory, evidence from primary and/or secondary sources to craft a coherent argument, or by connecting to another historical period or context. Examples could include (but are not limited to) the following:  • Comparing the rise of the New Right to earlier political coalitions such as the one that formed around the New Deal • Comparing the rise of the New Right to the contemporary rise of the New Left • Continuing the story of the rise of the New Right to include the Contract with America and the Republican recapture of control of the House of Representatives. • Linking the rise of the New Right in this period to the later emergence of the Tea Party  Question 2  Evaluate the extent to which the Seven Years’ War (French and Indian War, 1754–1763) marked a turning point in American relations with Great Britain, analyzing what changed and what stayed the same from the period before the war to the period after it.  A.

Synthesis:  0–1 point Skill assessed: Synthesis Response synthesizes the argument, evidence, and context into a coherent and persuasive essay by accomplishing one or more of the following as relevant to the question.  Appropriately extends or modifies the stated thesis or argument.     1 point  OR  Explicitly employs an additional appropriate category of analysis (e.g., political, economic, social, cultural, geographic, race, gender) beyond that called for in the prompt. 1 point  OR  Appropriately connects the topic of the question to other historical periods, geographical areas, contexts, or circumstances. 1 point  Response does not synthesize the argument, evidence, and context into a coherent and persuasive essay. 0 points  Response is completely blank. —     Question 3 (continued)  SCORING NOTES  Responses define the chronological beginning and end points for the essay; the focus of the response helps determine what information is considered appropriate.  Thesis  An acceptable thesis would evaluate the extent to which the Mexican-American War was a turning point, indicating the extent of change OR continuity. Note: Indicating explicitly the extent of change implies the extent of continuity, and vice versa.  Possible thesis statements emphasizing change could include the following: • The Mexican-American War marked a turning point in the debate over slavery in the U.S. by unleashing a massive tension between the North and South on what land would be free and what land would be slave. • The Mexican-American War marked a huge turning point in the debate over slavery because it brought to light the controversy of territorial self-determination and asked the question that would define America on a fundamental level: is this country one of slavery or one of freedom?  Possible thesis statements emphasizing continuity could include the following: • The questions of slavery and expansion were inevitable political issues. • The culmination of Manifest Destiny only sped up the process.  Possible thesis statements modifying the position could include the following: The Compromise of 1850 with its controversial points, not the Mexican-American War, was the major turning point of 19th century.  Support for Argument Possible evidence that could be used includes the following:  BEFORE Mexican-American War • Manifest Destiny • Missouri Compromise (1820) • Increasing fear of slave power • William Lloyd Garrison, The Liberator (1830) • Gag rule • Frederick Douglass • Annexation of Texas (1845)            Mexican-American War and AFTER • Opposition to Mexican-American War among northern Whigs • Abraham Lincoln Spot Resolutions (1846) • Wilmot Proviso (1846) • Popular sovereignty • Stephen A.

Sandford (1857)  Question 3 (continued)  Application of Historical Thinking Skills • Essays earn 1 point by describing the ways in which the debates over slavery were different from OR similar to debates over slavery that preceded and/or followed the Mexican-American War. • Essays earn 2 points by analyzing the ways in which the debates over slavery were different from AND similar to debates over slavery that preceded and/or followed the Mexican-American War, providing specific examples to illustrate the analysis. • Examples of issues that influenced the debate over slavery could include the following: o Discussion of political balance based on slavery before and after the war o Discussion of extent of cotton cultivation before and after the war o Discussion of the abolition movement before and after the war o Discussion of the ideologies of free soil and free labor before and after the war  Synthesis Responses can earn the synthesis point by crafting a persuasive and coherent essay. This could be accomplished by but not limited to the following: • Providing a conclusion that extends or modifies the analysis in the essay by explicitly assessing the impact of the Mexican-American War on American Indian and/or Hispanic people living in the territory transferred from Mexico to the United States. • Introducing another category of historical analysis by explicitly calling out the cultural or gender, or racial elements of a political story.  • Making a connection to another historical period or context. Examples could include the following:  o Concretely and explicitly linking the Mexican-American War to earlier imperial conflicts such as the Seven Years’ War and the American Revolution o Explicitly linking the Mexican-American War to subsequent developments such as the Civil War and Reconstruction or the 20th century Civil Rights movement   AP® United States History 2015 Scoring Guidelines © 2015 The College Board.
