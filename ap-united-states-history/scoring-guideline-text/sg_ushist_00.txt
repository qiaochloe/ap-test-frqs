How successful was organized labor in improving the position of workers in the period from 1875 to 1900?  Analyze the factors that contributed to the level of success achieved. Use the documents and your knowledge of the period from 1875 to 1900 to construct your response. NOTE:  Inferences and outside information are in bold print. DOCUMENT A: Source: Hours and Wages of Industrial Workers 1875 - 1891 Document Information: -Average daily hours declined from 9.9 to 9.4 between 1875 and 1891. -The index of average daily wages rose slightly from 169.2 to 172.5 between 1875 and 1891 (although there was a larger increase between 1879 and 1891). Inferences: -There has been very little improvement in shortening the hours worked. -Labor unions are typically campaigning for the 8-hour workday. -Average daily wages have only increased slightly comparing 1875 and 1891. -The drop in wages between 1875 and 1879 is probably the result of the depression of 1873, when management slashed wages followed by recovery about 1880. -The chart omitted the years of the panic and depression of 1893+. DOCUMENT B: Source: Editorial, The New York Times, July 18, 1877 Document Information: -The writer claims the strike is hopeless, a rash act by resentful men. -He says the strikers don't understand their own interests. -This is a strike on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. -The strikers are “bold and determined” and have the sympathy of a large number of the people in their community. Inferences: -This is the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, the first great American mass strike. -Newspapers were often hostile to strikes and labor unions and represented management views. -Large crowds in Baltimore attacked the militia sent to break up the strike. -The Pittsburgh militia sided with the strikers. -President Hayes sent federal troops to quell the strikes and riots. -The accusation by the B&O that the strikers were infiltrated by communists helped to undermine the strike. DOCUMENT C: Source: Thomas Nast Cartoon in Harper's Weekly, 1878. Document Information: -The cartoon is entitled "ALWAYS KILLING THE GOOSE THAT LAYS THE GOLDEN EGG." -It shows a shocked labor representative staring at the dead goose - marked capital. -"Communism" stands to the side saying ("without responsibility") "…its too bad, now I thought he was just full of them." -The "capital" goose had laid wages -  one is in the pocket of the worker, another is in the basket. -A sad wife & son stand in the doorway. -Quotations on the wall  suggest labor violence and that communism involves giving workers earnings to "lazy and drunken workmen". -In large letters it proclaims "STRIKE! STRIKE!! STRIKE!!! AS THEY DID LAST JULY DOWN WITH CAPITAL". Inferences: -The communist has manipulated the worker to destroy capitalism. -The strike "last July" was the Great Railroad Strike from Doc. B. -Newspapers and magazines (like the middle class Harper's Weekly) frequently branded all labor movements as radical. -Supposed ties to the communist (and anarchist) movements hurt the credibility of organized labor, especially with the middle classes. -Thomas Nast, known for his attacks on Tweed, took a conservative position on organized labor. DOCUMENT D: Source: The testimony of a machinist before the Senate Committee on Labor and Capital, 1883. Document Information: -The machinist says there is a great difference between conditions under which machinery is made now and 10 years earlier. -He says that 10 years ago a machinist learned nearly the entire trade. -Now he says that a machinist's trade has been subdivided into many small tasks. -Those who make sewing machines, he says, are no longer considered machinists because the job has been thoroughly subdivided. -Now, he says, 100 men can do what it took 300-400 men to do 15 years ago. Inferences: -Formerly skilled jobs have now been divided into smaller tasks - depriving the workers of their status as skilled workers in some cases. -The increased number of semi-skilled and unskilled jobs in many factories which deprived unions of leverage when dealing with employers. -Specialization led to job loss. DOCUMENT E: Source: Western Union Telegraph Company employee contract, 1883. Document Information: -The contract says that as a condition of being re-employed by the Western Union company the employee will abandon membership in any organization that tries to regulate conditions of employment. -The employee promises to not renew membership in any such organization while employed by the company. Inferences: -This is a yellow dog contract or ironclad oath, used to fire employees who join labor unions. -It was used by management to control its labor force. -It can also suggest other methods of breaking unions such as blacklisting, company spies, Pinkertons etc. DOCUMENT F: Source: "TOO MANY COOKS SPOIL THE BROTH" Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, January 8, 1887. Document Information: -This cartoon shows the "Labor Interest Broth" sitting on top of the "Assessment Range. -Four cooks are fighting each other over the broth -  labor union, anarchist, socialist & Knight of Labor. Inferences: -Too many groups are fighting to represent laborers and this lack of unity hurts the labor movement. -The involvement of anarchists and socialists, although small groups within the labor movement, allow their enemies to brand all labor groups as "radical". -The Knights of Labor and the labor movement in general were in very bad shape because of the Haymarket Riot (which occurred less than a year before this cartoon was published). -Magazines and newspapers tended to be hostile to organized labor. DOCUMENT G: Source: Coroner's list of the killed, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, July 7 1892 (The New York Times, July 8, 1892) Document Information: -11 men are listed by the coroner as killed "yesterday" in Pittsburgh; the actual count may be higher. -Several were employed at the Homestead plant. -One is listed as a striker. -2 were Pinkerton detectives - one from New York, the other from Chicago. Inferences: -This document refers to the Homestead Strike and Lockout. -The mention of the Pinkerton detectives could lead to a discussion of their use in the strike & the great battle at the plant. -Pinkertons were also used as spies and  protected strikebreakers in many other strikes & labor disputes. -The power management had when dealing with unskilled & semiskilled workers . -The coming of the panic & depression of 1893 & how it hurt organized labor -Several of the strikers appear to come from different ethnic groups -- (Markowisky and Sotak for example was probably of Eastern European origin - others appear to be of German or English ancestry) - making it hard to organize & management sometimes deliberately divided their workers in this manner. DOCUMENT H: Source: United States Supreme Court, In re Debs, 1895. Document Information: -The national government, says the court, has the Constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce which gives it power over commerce carried by railroads. -It is, therefore, the duty of the government to keep railroads free from obstruction. Inferences: -The document is referring to the Pullman strike . -The Supreme Court upheld the right of the federal government to send Eugene Debs to prison in this case where he converted to Socialism. -The federal government found a new weapon to use against strikers -- the court injunction, which the court upheld in this case. -The Railroad Managers Association used the protection of the mails as the excuse to bring in federal troops -- attaching Pullman cars & mail cars to every train. -The national government asserted jurisdiction over the state of Illinois . -The Supreme Court was very conservative and hostile to organized labor in the years 1875-1900. DOCUMENT I: Source: Testimony of Samuel Gompers before a commission established by the House of Representatives on the Relations and Conditions of Capital and Labor, 1899. Document Information: -Gompers says that workers find that improvements in methods of production and distribution are constantly being made. -Workers, therefore, he argues need occasionally to strike or all advantages will go to the employers and all injuries to the employees. -Rights, he says, have been gained by the people through sacrifices and persistency. Inferences: -Samuel Gompers was the founder of the American Federation of Labor. -The AFL did survive the 19th century because it primarily included skilled workers. -The AFL kept out of involvement in politics and built up strike funds, focusing on "bread and butter" issues. -It survived the depression of 1893 (which was just ending when this testimony was given) when many other unions failed. -The AFL also excluded most women, African Americans,  unskilled workers and some immigrants. -Gompers was one of the first American union leaders to focus on collective bargaining and the strike as a political weapon.  AP US History 2000 Outside information for Question 1: DBQ FAILURES TO IMPROVE POSITION OF WORKERS 1875-1900 •Most unions collapsed -- NLU, Knights, ARU - esp. during depressions. •Most women & minorities were not accepted into organized labor. •Most strikes were crushed & achieved few goals --Great RR Strike, Homestead, Pullman etc. •Many skilled/craft jobs were replaced with lower paying jobs  due to new technology & reorganization of business. •Less than 10% of industrial workers were unionized by 1900. •Massive immigration made it easy to replace workers. SUCCESSES IN IMPROVING POSITION OF WORKERS 1875-1900 •Workers' determination to fight back did at times make the employers "think twice" -- after the RR strike of 1877 for example, employers were slower to slash wages. •Congress did (to a very small extent) limit some immigration (Chinese, paupers, contract labor) -a demand of organized labor. •More workers were getting the pre Civil War demand of 10 hour days . •Some states gave unions legal recognition & passed health & safety laws to protect workers. •Some companies (the Baltimore & Ohio RR,  for example) provided pension plans --Pittsburgh Steel pioneered profit sharing. •The AFL did survive the depression of the 1890's - by 1901 it had over 1 million members - almost 1/3 of all skilled workers. •Settlement workers as activists for labor. TECHNIQUES USED BY MANAGEMENT TO DEFEAT LABOR 1875-1900 •Yellow Dog Contract/ Ironclad Oath --swear not join union (see Doc E) •Blacklist •Lockout (ex.

As long as they are discussing opposition to the extension of slavery into the territories we have accepted the term as a minor error. Confusion between non-extension and the abolition of slavery is a major error. The question does not call for a comparison of the relative importance of moral arguments and political actions Political actions may extend beyond legislation Thoreau’s refusal to pay taxes that may support the Mexican War John Brown’s attack at Pottawatomie Creek Discussions of political activity need not go beyond the actions in opposition to the spread of slavery (i.e., neglecting reference to Maine entering the Union as a free state, the abolition of slave trading in D.C., or the Fugitive Slave Act does not undermine a discussion of the Missouri Compromise or the Compromise of 1850, when the student has focused on those components of the debate related to opposition to the spread of slavery. Discussions of the moral augments in opposition to the spread of slavery are limited, and when used are general in nature.  Some students conclude that moral issues were not involved in the Missouri Compromise, some suggest that the immorality of slavery was at issue. Either response is acceptable.  In either case, the better essays that begin with Clay’s 1820 compromise include comments about the growing importance of the moral arguments over time. A number of students have conflated the Missouri Compromise and the Kansas-Nebraska Act into a single factor (noting that K-N rescinds the line dividing free territory from slave), and then address a second factor. Treat that as two, not three factors.  We have seen several examples of students including the entry of Texas into the Union as part of the Compromise of 1850. Generally, students begin with Missouri and then address either (1) Kansas-Nebraska, or (2) Compromise of 1850.
