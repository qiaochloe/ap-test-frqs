Hayes, as representative of the federal government after the Compromise of 1877, in the foreground plowing a furrow using a plough fashioned from rifles and swords. The plough is labelled “Let ‘Em Alone Policy.” o A bloody shirt (a symbol for the Civil War) is being buried alongside other tools for war. o African Americans are depicted as once again working in fields, picking cotton, and moving bales of cotton. o The background shows prosperous farms, trade, and shipping. Scoring Notes a) Response briefly explains ONE historical perspective expressed by the artist about the changes from the period 1869–1877 to the period 1877–1881. NOTE: It is acceptable for test-takers to explain the historical perspective expressed by the artist without reference to specific cartoons. Examples of responses to (a) that would earn the point: The South is portrayed as victimized from 1869–1877, and the South is portrayed as prospering and productive from 1877-1881. • Evidence for victimized South (1869-1877) could include but is not limited to: o North/Government: carpetbaggers, military occupation (bayonet rule), federal government exceeding its authority, a vindictive northern-dominated government as a result of the Civil War seeking to punish the South. o South: oppression (bent over and chained white woman), agricultural collapse (burned-out farm), economic ruin (sinking ship). OR • Evidence for a prospering and productive South (1877-1881) could include but is not limited to: o North/Government: Compromise of 1877 resulting in “Let ‘Em Alone Policy” as end of federal control, withdrawal of federal troops (rifles and sword turned into plough), end of Civil War vindictiveness (bayonet rule and bloody shirt buried). o South: better off economically and socially (prospering farms, trade, shipping), African Americans depicted as once again working in fields. Short Answer Question 3 (continued) b) Response briefly explains how ONE specific event or development led to a historical change suggested by the images. Examples of responses to (b) that would earn the point: • Opposition to Reconstruction policies • Violence against former slaves and Reconstruction-era political leaders (both white and black) in the South by organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan • The emergence of Redeemer governments in the South and the removal of military occupation • The Compromise of 1877 • The weakening resolve of the northern public and politicians • Migration into or out of South: African Americans leaving the South (Exodusters 1879), Chinese coming to South as farm laborers, Northern whites moving to the South • The emergence of sharecropping in the South as a new form of servitude for African Americans c) Response briefly explains ONE specific result in the period 1877–1900 of a historical change suggested by the images. Examples of responses to (c) that would earn the point: • Economics o The agricultural and industrial recovery of the New South (e.g., sharecropping, tenant farming, steel factories, textile mills) o The continued impoverishment of the South (e.g., white southerners’ continued poverty, economic productivity, and standard of living declined after the war) • Politics o End of Radical Reconstruction o Decline of Republican Party in the South o Shift to Redeemer (Democratic) government in Southern states o Rise of Populist Party and popularity in South/agrarian reform for Southern white and African American farmers • Race relations o The rise of racial violence and legal segregation (Jim Crow laws, Plessy v.

Policymakers . . . shared a common . . . conviction that the United States not only should, but could, control political conditions in South Vietnam, as elsewhere throughout much of the world. This conviction had led Washington to intervene progressively deeper in South Vietnamese affairs over the years. . . . This conviction prompted policymakers to escalate the war. . . . Domestic political pressures exerted an equally powerful . . . influence over the course of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. . . . Another ‘loss’ to communism in East Asia risked renewed and devastating attacks from the right.” Brian VanDeMark, historian, Into the Quagmire, 1995 “The escalation of U.S. military intervention [in Vietnam] grew out of a complicated chain of events and a complex web of decisions that slowly transformed the conflict . . . into an American war. . . . [President Lyndon Johnson] made the critical decisions that took the United States into war almost without realizing it. . . . Although impersonal forces . . . influenced the president’s Vietnam decisions, those decisions depended primarily on his character, his motivations, and his relationships with his principal advisers. . . . The war in Vietnam was not lost in the field, nor was it lost on the front pages of The New York Times or on the college campuses. It was lost in Washington, D.C., even before Americans assumed sole responsibility for the fighting.” H. R.

Maximum Possible Points: 7 Points  Rubric  Notes  A: Thesis and Argument Development (0–2)  Thesis: Presents a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim and responds to all parts of the question. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion. (1 point) Neither the introduction nor the conclusion is necessarily limited to a single paragraph.  Acceptable thesis statements must explicitly make a historically defensible, evaluative claim regarding the extent of change in ideas about American independence from 1763 to 1783. Acceptable examples: • From 1763 to 1783 colonial ideas about American independence changed from just questioning British policies to calling for revolution. • From 1763 to 1783 colonial ideas about American independence did not change much because, throughout the period, many colonists continued to oppose the Patriot cause.  Argument Development: Develops and supports a cohesive argument that recognizes and accounts for historical complexity by explicitly illustrating relationships among historical evidence such as contradiction, corroboration, and/or qualification. (1 point)  To earn this point responses must explain the relationship of historical evidence to a complex and cohesive argument and do so throughout the essay. Ways that evidence can be related to the argument include the following: • Contradiction (e.g., using evidence to address a counterargument to the main argument in the essay) • Corroboration (e.g., combining multiple pieces of evidence to support a single argument) • Qualification (e.g., using evidence to present an argument that is subsequently made more complex by noting exceptions)  B: Document Analysis(0–2)  Document Analysis (Content): Utilizes the content of at least six of the documents to support the stated thesis or a relevant argument. (1 point)  See document summaries for details. • Doc 1: Teapot, 1766–1770 • Doc 2: Virginia Resolves, 1769 • Doc 3: Samuel Adams, Rights of Colonists as Men, 1772 • Doc 4: Quaker address to Pennsylvania Assembly, 1775 • Doc 5: Janet Schaw, Journal of a Lady of Quality, 1775 • Doc 6: Charles Inglis, The Costs of Revolution, 1776 • Doc 7: Thomas Paine, American Crisis, 1776  Document Analysis (Sourcing): Explains the significance of the author’s point of view, author’s purpose, historical context, and/or audience for at least four documents. (1 point)  Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) C: Using Evidence Beyond the Documents (0–2)  Contextualization: Situates the argument by explaining the broader historical events, developments, or processes immediately relevant to the question. (1 point) The contextualization point is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference, but instead requires an explanation, typically consisting of multiple sentences or a full paragraph.  This point can be earned by explaining historical events, developments, or processes that occurred before, during, or after the time frame of the question. Common examples might include the following: • Enlightenment ideas • Discussion of factors separating Patriots and Loyalists • Shifts in British policies and changes in the mercantile system after the end of the French and Indian War (Seven Years’ War) in 1763  Evidence beyond the Documents: Provides an example or additional piece of specific evidence beyond those found in the documents to support or qualify the argument. (1 point) This example must be different from the evidence used to earn other points on this rubric. This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference. Responses need to reference an additional piece of specific evidence and explain how that evidence supports or qualifies the argument.  Common examples might include the following, with appropriate elaboration: • Articles of Confederation (1781) • Boston Massacre (1770) • Boston Tea Party (1773) • Boycotts / nonimportation movements • Committees of correspondence • Declaration of Independence (1776) • Benjamin Franklin • Alexander Hamilton • Thomas Jefferson • George Washington  D: Synthesis (0–1)  Synthesis: Extends the argument by explaining the connection between the argument and either a development in a different historical period or geographical area and/or a course theme and/or approach that is not the focus of the essay. (1 point) The synthesis point is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference.  Common examples might include the following, with appropriate explanation: • Different period or area: French Revolution; Haitian Revolution; United States Civil War • Different theme: economic history  If response is completely blank, enter --for all four score categories A, B, C, and D. AP® UNITED STATES HISTORY 2017 SCORING GUIDELINES Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Document Summaries Document  Content  Explains the significance of point of view, purpose, context, and/or audience by elaborating on examples such as the following:  1.

Thesis and Argument Development (2 points) a) Thesis Responses earn one point by presenting a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim that evaluates the extent of change in ideas about American independence from 1763 to 1783 (1 point). While the thesis does not need to be a single sentence, it does need to be discrete, meaning it cannot be pieced together from across multiple places within the essay. It can be located in either the introduction or the conclusion, but not split between the two. Note: Theses need to address change but do not necessarily need to specifically address continuity as well. Examples of acceptable theses: • “The ideas about American independence changed greatly from 1763 to 1783. In the beginning, colonists only wanted representation and a say in the legislation of new laws, but by 1783 Americans wanted true freedom from British rule.” • “From 1763–1783, ideas of American independence changed from the colonies blindly accepting the tyranny of the British by religious rights of divine kings to believing in natural rights of individuals against British rule.” Examples of unacceptable theses: • “The extent of change in American ideas about American independence from 1763 to 1783 was a great change. As feelings of wanting independence from Britain intensified, so did means of seizing freedom. The American people’s feelings did not remain static and only became stronger.” (This thesis does not address the change in ideas that is the focus of the prompt.) • “From 1763 to 1783, ideas about American independence drastically changed as many colonists shifted from being loyalists to patriots.” (This thesis does not address the prompt’s focus on ideas and seems to turn the question into a different question that discusses division in colonial society.) b) Argument Development To earn this point, responses must explain the relationship of historical evidence to a complex and cohesive argument and do so throughout the essay (1 point). Examples of acceptable argument development: • “Many factors had played a part in the rise of those dissents in the colonies, but none had greater influence then the ideals of the Enlightenment. Central to the opposition of the taxes lied in the idea of ‘not taxation without representation’. To be taxed by a parliament an ocean away seemed not only absurd, but ridiculous. Enlightenment ideals of personal freedom and choice in an individual began to spread throughout the colonies. People like Sam Adams, who led the radical group Sons of Liberty, began to challenge the authority of man. He claimed only man himself can direct his own actions and decisions, not the rule of any legislative authority or man. (Doc. 3)” (This shows strong corroboration of evidence to support a larger argument.) Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Examples of unacceptable argument development: • “Also, there were people ‘on the fence.’ Many religious leaders just wanted peaceful harmony. (Doc. 4) However many were forced to choose sides. In the case of the revolution, violence usually won against nonviolence, so that was how many colonists thought.” (This attempt to use a piece of evidence to back an assertion is too general. This statement was indicative of an entire essay that lacked a complex and cohesive argument.) • “Those colonists who wanted independence from the Mother Country (England) believed that they should have the freedom to leave a society that has intolerable oppression whether it be civic or religious (Doc. 3). In addition they also believed that this society was unjust (Doc. 7) and forced them to take action into something they didn’t believe in for their own well being (Doc. 5). These colonists wanted their freedom as a way to pursue their happiness.” (The premise of the paragraph is not complex for it is simply mirroring sentiments contained in the documents, and the discussion of the documents is superficial.) B. Document Analysis (2 points) a) Document Content Responses earn one point by utilizing the content of at least six of the documents to support the stated thesis or a relevant argument (1 point). Responses cannot earn a point by merely quoting or paraphrasing the documents with no connection to a thesis or argument. (See the document summaries section for descriptions of document content.) Examples of acceptable uses of content from a document to support a thesis or relevant argument: • “Charles Inglis uses reason to note that the colonies would be unable to sustain themselves without British support because the colonies don’t make enough money through agriculture and commerce.” • “He claimed only man himself can direct his own actions and decisions, not the rule of any legislative authority or man (Doc. 3). These ideals, of course, contradict the essence of colonialism.” Examples of unacceptable uses of content from a document to support a thesis or relevant argument: • “Charles Inglis brought to point the economic unfairness that if it weren’t for the limitation set before them they would be better off financially, but the Europeans were taking everything.” (This statement misconstrues the content of the document.) • “According to Doc 4, Quaker leaders are saying that colonies should stay loyal to Britain because of the commercial interests colonies get.” (This statement mistakenly gives the reason for Quaker opposition to the revolutionaries reflected in the document as commercial when, in fact, it was religious.) b) Significance of Point of View, Purpose, Context, and/or Audience Responses earn one point by explaining the significance of the author’s point of view, author’s purpose, historical context, and/or audience for at least four documents (1 point). Examples of acceptable explanations of the significance of the author’s point of view: • “Sam Adams had the point of view of a patriot and it was significant because it showed the radicalization of many colonists’ views stemming from direct and bloody confrontations involving quartered British troops in cities such as Boston.” • “Thomas Paine, with his publication of Common Sense, popularized the revolutionary sentiment for many Americans.” Examples of unacceptable explanations of the significance of the author’s point of view: • “Sam Adams was a loyalist who wanted to promote peace with the king and he supported the Olive Branch petition.” (This statement incorrectly identifies Sam Adams as a Loyalist.) • “As Janet Schaw, a Scot visiting her brother in Wilmington, North Carolina reflects, any officer can enter a man’s plantation without being allowed to and he can threaten the plantation owner.” (Though Schaw’s point of view is identified as a Scot, the response does not explain the significance of ideas about American independence that might be associated with this perspective.) Examples of acceptable explanations of the significance of the author’s purpose: • “Adams aims to establish rule by the consent of the people, which is later written in the Constitution when the US wanted to ensure it does not become like Britain.” • “The sentiment that taxes should be discussed with colonists through proper deliberation became common during the time period, and was expressed by many (Doc. 2).” Examples of unacceptable explanations of the significance of the author’s purpose: • “Although the cost of war would be high, Inglis argued for an independent economy as a necessity of life.” (This statement incorrectly states the purpose by arguing that Inglis desired an independent economy when in fact he was arguing against leaving the British Empire.) • “The delegates at the House of Burgesses used the Virginia Resolves as propaganda to increase involvement towards the Revolutionary War.” (The purpose of this document was to influence colonists to advocate for monarchical assistance in changing Parliamentary policies, not to push for war.) Examples of acceptable explanations of the significance of the historical context of a document: • “Inglis’s statement illustrates how some remained committed to England because of profitability of mercantile trade relationships.” • “The teapot was made during the opposed taxing, but it also demonstrated how Great Britain did try to settle with the colonists, by repealing taxes such at the Stamp Act.” Example of unacceptable explanations of the significance of the historical context of a document: • “The historical context of Doc 4 [January 1775] is the first shots at Lexington and Concord [April 1775].” (This statement ascribes the situation of the document to the Battles of Lexington and Concord, which occurred after the document was written and thus could not be part of its authorship). Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Examples of acceptable explanations of the significance of the audience: • Burgesses was based on English Parliament, and this shows the connection established between the two.” • “Adams desires to confirm the ideas of the colonists who are fed up with British rule as well as advocate his desire to see American independence.” Examples of unacceptable explanations of the significance of the audience: • “Addressing Loyalists, Thomas Paine stated that tyranny must be fought against.”(The audience is incorrect and the significance of the audience is not identified.) • “The intended audience of Doc. 2 is the British Crown so they feel impelled to negotiate with the colonists to reach an agreement.” C. Using Evidence Beyond the Documents (2 points) a) Contextualization Responses earn a point for contextualization by explaining the broader historical events, developments, or processes immediately relevant to the question (1 point). To earn the point the essay must situate the thesis, argument, or parts of the argument by accurately and explicitly connecting changes in ideas about American independence from 1763 to 1783 to larger historical processes. The context can be from before, during, or after the period of the question as long as the response accurately and explicitly connects the context to the topic. Examples might include the following: • Enlightenment ideas moved through trans-Atlantic exchanges and popularized concepts of natural rights, republican ideologies, the rejection of inherited authority, and social contract theory. • Patriots and Loyalists could be separated by social standing, connections to the British government, and their ideas about the sources of legitimate authority in society. • The legacy of the English Civil War influenced ideas of the rights of English people and British traditions of liberty and self-rule. • Shifts in British policies and changes in the mercantile system after the end of the French and Indian War (Seven Years’ War) in 1763 resulted in the end of salutary neglect, the acceleration of taxation, and the imposition of other acts on the North American colonies. • The formation of the Stamp Act Congress (1765) and later the committees of correspondence or shadow governments in the colonies by the early 1770s furthered resistance to British policies and were precursors to the First and Second Continental Congress. • Pacifist and separatist religious ideologies persisted in the colonies, which created opposition to engaging in a revolutionary movement or bloodshed. • The experiences of American Indians and enslaved African Americans during the Revolution differed from that of the British colonists. • Support in Great Britain for engaging in a war in order to retain the British North American colonies dwindled and some degree of sympathy existed in Great Britain for the colonial independence movement. • Revolutionary ideas were adapted and changed in the United States Constitution. Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Examples of acceptable contextualization: • “The French and Indian War caused Britain to increase involvement in the affairs of the American colonies. British leaders, such as George Grenville, believed that the colonists, who had been beneficiaries of the war, be required to assist in paying the debt incurred by it. This was achieved through a series of taxes imposed upon the colonists.” • “Prior to the fight for independence from 1763 to 1783, colonists were not properly enforced to follow certain laws, such as the Navigation Acts, a restriction on colonial trade. Britain’s treatment towards the colonists is described as Salutary Neglect, which contributed to a sense of freedom and rights for the colonists.” Examples of unacceptable contextualization: • “This tax along with the end of Salutary Neglect was a shock to the colonists and caused anger.” • “As the American colonies were being constructed and an American government formed, its inhibitors began to seek independence from Great Britain. This period was called, the Enlightenment Era.” b) Evidence Beyond the Documents Responses earn a separate point for providing an example or additional piece of specific evidence beyond those found in the documents to support or qualify the argument (1 point). This example must be different from the evidence used to earn other points on this rubric. This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference. The specific example or evidence should be immediately relevant to the question. Examples might include the following with elaboration: • Articles of Confederation • Battles at Lexington and Concord (1775) • Boston Massacre (1770) • Boston Tea Party (1773) • Boycotts / nonimportation movements • Committees of correspondence • Continental Army • Daughters of Liberty • Declaration of Independence (1776) • Declaration of Rights and Grievances (1765) • Enlightenment ideas: natural rights, social contract, republicanism • First and Second Continental Congresses • Benjamin Franklin • French and Indian (Seven Years’) War (1754–63) • Alexander Hamilton • Patrick Henry • Homespun cloth and nonconsumption • Intolerable (Coercive) Acts (1774) • Thomas Jefferson • Liberty Tea • Militias • Olive Branch Petition • Royal Proclamation of 1763 • Quartering Act (1765) • Salutary Neglect • Sons of Liberty • Sugar (Revenue) Act (1764) • Tea Act (1773) • Townshend Acts (1767) • George Washington Examples of providing an example or additional piece of specific evidence beyond those found in the documents to support or qualify the argument: • “These ideals, of course, contradict the essence of colonialism. Enlightenment began the shift from being ruled by others to ruling yourself. Colonists wanted more control over their own lives. Another thinker, Thomas Paine, also raised questions surrounding the nature of government rule in Common Sense.” • “Beyond the documents, the Olive Branch petition was proposed by the colonies as a last ditch effort to spare change without the expense of war. The petition affirmed the colonies’ loyalty to the king while also suggesting reforms. Despite such attempts for peace, King George III promptly rejected the negotiations, sparking the potential for war to an elevated degree.” Examples of improperly providing an example or additional piece of specific evidence beyond those found in the documents to support or qualify the argument: • “Soon after colonists recognized that England was giving them salutary neglect, after Common Sense was written and revealed other factors, finally in July 1776 the colonist had achieved their independence and achieved their freedom and had the room to preserve their happiness.” (This collection of factual evidence does not directly answer the question but rather presents events that occurred previous to the Revolution and that bare no relationship to a developed argument.) • “The Stamp Act required a tax on stamps in the United States.” (This piece of information does not qualify or support an argument.) D. Synthesis (1 point) Responses earn a point for synthesis by extending their arguments in one of two possible ways (1 point). a) Responses can extend their argument by appropriately connecting the extent of change in ideas about American independence from 1763 to 1783 to other historical periods, situations, eras, or geographical areas. These connections must consist of more than just a phrase or reference. A response that lists events from other time periods or areas but does not explain how they relate to the argument cannot earn a synthesis point. Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Examples of acceptable synthesis by appropriately connecting the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographic area: • “Extreme ideas about American independence changed the way Americans would view foreign nations in the future. During the French Revolution, several Americans, mainly Democratic Republicans sympathized with the French and raised support for aiding the French in their own fight for independence. This feeling of sympathy can largely be a result of America’s own strong fight for independence just years earlier.” • “This split between the colonists in America can parallel to the split in Americans during the Civil War. Just like how the loyalists were loyal to their previous rulers, the union/north was loyal to the federal government. Similarly, the patriots and the confederates wished to break away from their former government. Both the patriots and the Confederates fought against a government they believed was treating them unfairly. Patriots believed they were being taxed unfairly and Confederates believed the federal government was favoring Northern industry and trying to slowly end slavery.” Examples that do not accurately connect the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographic area: • “This drastic change in attitude towards a leader is not uncommon. The French Revolution also shows a country unhappy with their ruler. Like the colonists, the French overthrew their king.” (The parallel of ideas between the French Revolution and American Revolution is not defined by ideas that both revolutions represent but rather by feelings of unhappiness.) • “The ideas of the independence movement are quite drastic. This is similar to the rights of enslaved African Americans during the Civil War. At first, abolitionists wanted freedom for slaves because it was morally right. But then, freedom looked good for other reasons. Abolitionists realized that free blacks can help the economy, they could work for pay, which would allow them to spend money and help businesses. Abolition movements changed drastically, it was no longer a moral effort, but an economic effort to help everyone.” (Although a synthesis with the abolitionist movement might work if it paralleled similar paradigms, this one does not. An underlying fallacy is presented that abolitionists moved from wanting emancipation for moral reasons to economic reasons.) b) Responses can extend their arguments by appropriately connecting the extent of change in ideas about American independence from 1763 to 1783 to course themes and/or approaches to history that are not the main focus of the question. These connections must consist of more than just a phrase or reference. Example of acceptable synthesis by connecting the argument to different course themes and/or approaches to history that are not the main focus of the question: • “Thomas Paine in 1776 helped shape public opinion and garner public support for the war. Another example of shaping public opinion was the Truman Doctrine, which declared that the US would contain communism. This declaration shaped foreign policy and public opinion. It caused the public to initially support the Korean and later Vietnam War to fight communism.” Evaluate the extent to which the market revolution marked a turning point in women’s lives in the United States. In the development of your argument explain what changed and what stayed the same for women as a result of the market revolution within the period 1800–1850. (Historical thinking skill: Periodization) Maximum Possible Points: 6 Please note: • Each point of the rubric is earned independently, e.g., a response could earn the point for synthesis without earning the point for thesis. • Evidence credited for one point cannot be credited for another point. Points  Rubric  Notes  A: Thesis (0–1)  Thesis: Presents a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim and responds to all parts of the question. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion. (1 point) Neither the introduction nor the conclusion is necessarily limited to a single paragraph.  Acceptable thesis statements must explicitly make a historically defensible evaluative claim regarding the extent to which the market revolution marked a turning point in women’s lives. • “Although women continue to be labeled as economic, social, and political inferiors from before 1800 to after 1850, the market revolution does incite a change in women’s economic independence and social participation between 1800 and 1850.” • “To a certain extent, the market revolution marked a turning point in women’s lives in the United States due to labor opportunities for women and higher standard of living.”  B: Argument Development: Using the Targeted Historical Thinking Skill — Periodization (0–2)  Argument Development — Describes: Describes the ways in which the historical development specified in the prompt was different from or similar to developments that preceded AND followed.

(1 point)  Responses can earn one point by addressing the topic of the question by referring to specific examples or relevant evidence. Essays can earn this point without having a stated thesis or a relevant argument. Common examples might include the following: • Women worked in homes and on farms, with fathers, husbands, etc. or in family-owned business • Republican motherhood • Lowell Mills / Lowell girls / Waltham, MA • Cult of domesticity; separate spheres • Growth of middle-class ideals, consumer culture, and use of store-bought goods • Putting-out system • Seneca Falls Convention (1848)  Using Evidence — Effective Substantiation: Utilizes specific examples of evidence to fully and effectively substantiate the stated thesis or a relevant argument. (1 point) To fully and effectively substantiate the stated thesis or a relevant argument, responses must include a broad range of evidence that, through analysis and explanation, justifies the stated thesis or a relevant argument.  This point is earned by clearly and consistently linking significant evidence to the argument and showing how the evidence demonstrates the extent to which the market revolution marked a major turning point in women’s lives in the United States.  D: Synthesis (0–1)  Synthesis: Extends the argument by explaining the connection between the argument and either a development in a different historical period or geographical area and/or a course theme and/or approach that is not the focus of the essay.

Commonly seen examples might include: • Different period or area: the 20th-century suffrage movement; women’s work during the Second World War; the second-wave feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s • Different theme: African American women’s history or political history  If response is completely blank, enter --for all four score categories A, B, C, and D. Scoring Notes Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. A. Thesis (1 point) Acceptable thesis statements must explicitly make a historically defensible evaluative claim regarding the extent to which the market revolution marked a turning point in women’s lives in the United States (1 point). While the thesis does not need to be a single sentence, it does need to be discrete, meaning it cannot be pieced together from across multiple places within the essay. It can be located in either the introduction or the conclusion, but not split between the two. Examples of acceptable theses: • “Although women continue to be labeled as economic, social, and political inferiors from before 1800 to after 1850, the market revolution does incite a change in women’s economic independence and social participation between 1800 and 1850.” • “Among the most effected by the revolution were women, who for the first time in almost all of history experienced opportunities beyond the household. However, though such opportunities came about, a large degree of continued repression came with it, which thus sparked the beginning of the century long advocation for female equality in society.” • “To a certain extent, the market revolution marked a turning point in women’s lives in the United States due to labor opportunities for women and higher standard of living.” Unacceptable example of theses: • “The Market Revolution marked a major turning point in the daily life of an average woman in the United States.” (Although the response acknowledges the market revolution as a “major turning point,” it does not identify the ways in which it was a turning point in the lives of women in particular and therefore does not address all parts of the question.) B. Argument Development: Using The Targeted Historical Thinking Skill (2 points) a) Argument Development — Describes Responses earn one point by describing the way in which women’s lives in the United States changed or remained the same as a result of the market revolution within the period 1800–1850 (1 point). Note: In evaluating a turning point, responses must discuss developments that preceded AND followed in order to earn either point. Examples of acceptable descriptions of continuity or change: • “Republican Motherhood, for example, with the advantage of women to become educated in order to teach future generations of men for society, was replaced with the Cult of Domesticity. This change encouraged women to simply stay home to be of service for men.” • “Prior to the mid-1800s, there was a great emphasis on women working in and running the household. Women raised children and cooked and did other labor around the house, such as cleaning. With the market revolution, women wanted to work in places outside of the home, in factories and mills. Following the Second Great Awakening in the 1830s, women began to publicly advocate for the right to vote and supported various reforms throughout the country.” • “However, during this period of change, many ideals had stayed the same for women. Though the Cult of Domesticity changed from Republican motherhood, women were still seen as staying at the home. Women were still practically viewed as property of men almost as much as slaves, with all their own property belonging to said-husband.” Example of unacceptable description of continuity or change: • “The workforce during the market revolution drastically changed, more industrial work meant more factories and jobs which led to a greater involvement of women and children.” (The response does not describe what women’s lives were like before the market revolution and fails to adequately explain the extent of change in women’s work or rights.) b) Argument Development — Explains Responses earn one point by explaining the extent to which women’s lives in the United States changed and remained the same as a result of the market revolution within the period 1800–1850 (1 point). Example of acceptable explanation of the extent of continuity and change: • “Many manufacturers, such as textile mills, sought young women as a source of labor. For an example the Lowell System in Massachusetts provided benefits to young farm girls to entice them to work for the textile mills in Lowell. Thus, for the first time in American history, women began to leave the home and seek a paying job. Although women began to work, most women in this period still stayed at home as mothers and home makers because many still believed in the concept of separate spheres where a woman’s role was to be at home and a husband’s role was to gain money. Furthermore, the arrival of Irish and German immigrants in large numbers during this period also limited amount of labor opportunities for women as the immigrants worked in factories.” Example of unacceptable explanation of the extent of continuity and change: • “Providing for the family financially and being able to provide for themselves financially gave women a sense of freedom and helped them to start to see that they did not have to be completely reliant on men and start to see the unfair responsibilities between men and women.” (The response does not receive the second argument development point because it fails to explain the extent of change; it only notes that there was a change.) C. Argument Development: Using Evidence (2 points) a) Using Evidence — Examples Responses can earn one point by addressing the topic of the question by referring to specific examples or relevant evidence (1 point). Essays can earn this point without having a stated thesis or a relevant argument. Examples might include the following: • Women only worked in their homes, on their farms, with their fathers, husbands, etc. • Single women had very few rights; married women were under the control of their husbands. • American Revolution: Abigail Adams; “Remember the ladies”; Daughters of Liberty; Republican Motherhood. • Farm families produced at home most of what they needed and/or bartered with neighbors or purchased from local stores and rural craftsmen. o Girls and women worked on family farms or in family-owned businesses / guilds. • Market Revolution spawned distinct social classes: a small but wealthy business elite, a substantial middle class, and a mass of wage earners who did not own property. o Growth of middle-class ideals o Growth of consumer culture and store-bought goods in homes • Textile mills after the War of 1812. • Lowell Mills/Waltham system: girls in mills for a few years, then left for home, to marry, or move West. o Women of Lowell walked off job in 1834 to protest reduced wages. o Women’s activism in early labor movements. • Putting-out system / cottage industry. • Cult of domesticity; separate spheres. • Second Great Awakening: cooperative associations / utopian societies; pervasiveness of drinking culture led to temperance movement. • Reform movements led by Dorothea Dix; Grimke Sisters. • Girls were allowed to attend elementary school, but discouraged from attending higher levels. • Oberlin in Ohio accepted four female students in 1837. • Mount Holyoke in Massachusetts founded by Mary Lyon in 1837. • Catherine Beecher (education reform). • Suffrage Movement. o Seneca Falls Convention, 1848; Declaration of Sentiments o Lucretia Mott; Elizabeth Cady Stanton; Susan B. Anthony • Abolitionist movement. o Harriet Tubman; Sojourner Truth, “Ain’t I A Woman” • Northern women had more education opportunities and more opportunities to work in factories. • Southern women were more isolated; white women on plantations did very little work and had limited education outside of household concerns. • Western frontier women worked longer days beside their husbands. o Post-1812 migration westward: few lone pioneers, mostly in groups / with larger community. o Fewer women in the West so they gained some social and political power. • Immigrant women had far worse working conditions. Examples of using specific evidence to address the topic of the question: • “With the mills came Lowel Mill girls. Lowel Mill girls worked in the mills that produced textiles.  Lowel Mill girls tended to work long extensive hours in terrible conditions. They made money, but it wasn’t much.” • “Women worked many different kinds of factory jobs, but they were most commonly seen working with textiles. The lives of women in these jobs were incredibly difficult. . . . Although the amount of responsibility for women changed, traditional gender roles remained constant.” Example of unsuccessfully using evidence to address the topic of the question: • Evidence that is factually incorrect, confused about chronology, or not directly connected to the topic. o “With more and more women in the work force, there came needs for efficiency. A great symbol of women’s work force involvement was Rosie the Riveter.” (The response is too vague and does not have relevant examples in the correct time period.) b) Using Evidence — Effective Substantiation Responses earn a separate point by utilizing specific examples of evidence to fully and effectively substantiate a thesis or relevant argument about the extent to which the market revolution marked a turning point in women’s lives in the United States (1 point). Fully and effectively substantiating the thesis goes beyond merely providing many examples. This point is earned by clearly and consistently linking significant evidence to the argument and showing how the evidence demonstrates the extent to which the market revolution marked a turning point in women’s lives in the United States. Examples of utilizing evidence to substantiate an argument: • “The market revolution was successful in exposing women to the workforce, pushing them away from the early idea of “cult of domesticity” in colonial days that claimed a woman’s job was to watch the household and take care of the their children and husband. However, injustice was prevalent as women got paid less, and still did not have the right to vote.” • “The market revolution following the American Revolution established an increase in women’s participation in the work force.  Many established jobs in textile mills and helped propel the Northern economy. Additionally due to the development of technologies such as the interchangeable parts by Eli Whitney, more women joined the work force to increase the production of goods in the North. The creation of the Lowell System gave women the opportunity to be housed while working and obtain some amount of currency as income, but this was exceptionally low compared to the wage earning men.” Example of unsuccessfully attempting to substantiate an argument with evidence: • “The new manufacturing business, such as the Lowell Mills in Massachusetts, were predominantly staffed by young women … This was seen two ways –— through advocacy groups of political equality at the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848 as well as the social reforms lead by women during this time.” (Although the response utilizes specific examples, it does not fully and effectively substantiate an argument about the extent of change to merit the second point.) D. Synthesis (1 point) Responses earn a point for synthesis by extending their argument in one of two possible ways (1 point). a) Responses can extend their argument by explaining the connections between their argument and a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area. These connections must consist of more than just a phrase or reference. Example of synthesis by connecting the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area: • “The fight for women’s rights will continue throughout American history. But the development in women’s rights will eventually lead to women’s suffrage in 1920 and the women’s rights movement in 1960s. The increase in women’s rights from 1800–1850 resembles the increase in women’s opportunities during World War I when job market opened to women as men left home to fight in Europe. These two time periods both observed a growing women’s role in society as a result of increase in job opportunities and the increase in women’s rights in WWI will eventually lead to 19th Amendment in 1920.” Example that did not accurately connect the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area: • “During the time period, women’s roles in society became increasingly more important. As a result, the need for equality became imminent. However, the rights of African Americans were also being denied. The Market Revolution, thus, gave a platform for African Americans’ rights in plantations and other work places. With the rise of the movement for African Americans’ equality, the civil war would eventually define the outcome for their particular situation. Although African slaves were emancipated before women’s suffrage, the argument persists with both minority groups’ lives in society changing as a result of the market revolution.” (The response incorrectly attempts to connect how the market revolution changed the lives of women and African Americans but does not articulate the synthesis effectively.) b) Responses can extend their argument by explaining the connections between their argument and a course theme and/or approach to history that is not the focus of the essay (such as political, economic, social, cultural, or intellectual history). These connections must consist of more than just a phrase or reference. Example of synthesis by connecting the argument to a different course theme or approach to history: • “Similar to the women’s inability to achieve a voice in the 1800s despite their increased participation in the workforce, African Americans were also stagnant in the political voice and faced racial tensions even after they contributed greatly to the World Wars. They were segregated in their military regiments and many came back to the US with no added benefits, such as pensions, and racism prevailed in the US. Both groups the women and blacks, were suppressed due to either the dominance of their male counterparts or whites, respectively, despite their contributions and sacrifices to the country.” (The response effectively makes a connection to the theme of Politics and Power by linking the effect of the market revolution on women’s lives to the effect service in World War I and World War II on the lives of African Americans.) Evaluate the extent to which the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which guaranteed women the right to vote, marked a turning point in United States women’s history. In the development of your argument, explain what changed and what stayed the same from the period immediately before the ratification of the amendment (1865–1920) to the period immediately after (1920– 1940).

The amendment helped shift women to become more involved outside the home and more valued politically, and helped women to establish less social constraints, but it did not help women to become significantly more equal to men.”  • “While the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution did give women the right to vote, there were not many other drastic changes for women’s rights after it occurred, so the ratification of the 19th Amendment did not mark a turning point in U.S. women’s history.”  B: Argument Development: Usingthe Targeted Historical ThinkingSkill — Periodization (0–2)  Argument Development — Describes: Describes the ways in which the historical development specified in the prompt was different from or similar to developments that preceded AND followed.

Commonly seen examples might include: • Different period or area: the second-wave feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s; suffrage movements in Europe • Different theme: African American history or history of labor  If response is completely blank, enter --for all four score categories A, B, C, and D. Scoring Notes Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. A. Thesis (1 point) Acceptable thesis statements must explicitly make a historically defensible, evaluative claim regarding the extent to which the Nineteenth Amendment marked a turning point in United States women’s history (1 point). While the thesis does not need to be a single sentence, it does need to be discrete, meaning it cannot be pieced together from across multiple places within the essay. It can be located in either the introduction or the conclusion, but not split between the two. Examples of acceptable theses: • “Ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment played a large role in the lives of women in the United States. The amendment helped shift women to become more involved outside the home and more valued politically, and helped women to establish less social constraints, but it did not help women to become significantly more equal to men.” • “The ratification of the 19th Amendment marked a great turning point in United States women’s history. Before the ratification, women were not taken seriously and could not participate in any political activity. After the amendment was passed, women began to lead new, liberated lives.” • “The ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment was vastly important to women in the United States. Granting them the right to vote, women had worked for decades to reach this goal. The Nineteenth Amendment radically changed the political power of women and the feminist movement but barely changed the familial roles of women in America.” • “While the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution did give women the right to vote, there were not many other drastic changes for women’s rights after it occurred, so the ratification of the 19th Amendment did not mark a turning point in U.S. women’s history.” Unacceptable examples of theses: • “The 19th Amendment was ratified in 1920, 50 years after universal male suffrage. The 19th Amendment was a turning point in American history. Women had protested for women’s rights and suffrage at the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848. The ratification of the 19th amendment resulted in an increasing role of women in politics and the workforce, which was especially useful during the world wars where women had just as important of a role as men.” (This response fails to address the 19th Amendment as a turning point, and it focuses on events beyond the scope of the question, addressing time periods outside of those listed in the prompt.) • “The ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment which granted female suffrage allowed females to want to receive a higher education, work, and be more involved in politics.” (This response is brief and simplistic, and it fails to address the amendment as a turning point.) B. Argument Development: Using The Targeted Historical Thinking Skill (2 points) a) Argument Development — Describes Responses earn one point by describing how United States women’s history changed or remained the same in the periods before and after the Nineteenth Amendment (1 point). Note: In evaluating a turning point, responses must discuss developments that preceded AND followed in order to earn either point. Examples of acceptable descriptions of continuity or change: • “Women also gained a standing in government and politics when allowed to vote, leading to more women being involved in larger government roles. Women were finally able to gain rights in the working environment after the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment.” • “Now that women had the right to vote, they became more involved in politics, and were increasingly seeing themselves as equals to men. Since they saw what they were able to accomplish through persistent protest, they did not stop there. Women continued to fight for more causes, related to women’s rights or not … When they finally gained suffrage, women challenged the social norms and became increasingly involved in politics and political activism.” Examples of unacceptable descriptions of continuity or change: • “Women, with the 19th amendment, were given a say in political elections. They had the ability to vote which was a major difference in their lives prior to the amendment … What stayed the same, in accordance to politics, is the acceptance of women as being educated enough to vote.” (The element of change discussed in the response is too general, and the example of continuity is inaccurate.) • “Before the ratification of the nineteenth amendment, women had little improvement in becoming independent … Once Female Suffrage was granted, many women became more confident in being independent.” (The concept of female independence presented in the response is too general.) b) Argument Development — Explains Responses earn one point by explaining the extent to which women’s lives in the United States changed and remained the same in the periods before and after the Nineteenth Amendment (1 point). Examples of acceptable explanations of the extent of continuity and change: • “With the economic boom of the 1920s, women began to change style with flapper dresses and tradition by bypassing traditional courting methods. Women gained access to white-collar, secretarial jobs and were increasingly employed. However, despite all these changes, women in general were not very different, as far as roles in society. By the 1930s, the depression was in full force and women were back to being housewives, having lost their jobs to men or the depression.” • “For example, it was an unfair system of government if women could not be represented, therefore their rights would not be met by the government that was supposed to protect them. Still, many women, mostly in the South, were opposed to this idea, and preferred the traditional setting of staying home and not working. Women also mainly did not take place in fighting in the war, and were often nurses for the soldiers, and participated in many ways to help the war on the home front. Before women were given the right to vote, they remained at home to help their family, but soon after they would be involved in their country.” Examples of unacceptable explanations of the extent of continuity and change: • “After the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, the fight for equality was still not over. Women were allowed the basic human rights and the increase of working in the labor force.” (The response has no connection to an argument and no explanation of extent of continuity.) • “Due to this ratification, many women were given many more opportunities to have a voice & make changes.” (The response has no specific connection to an argument and no explanation of extent of change.) C. Argument Development: Using Evidence (2 points) a) Using Evidence — Examples Responses can earn one point by addressing the topic of the question by referring to specific examples or relevant evidence (1 point). Essays can earn this point without having a stated thesis or a relevant argument. Examples might include the following: • Separate spheres • Cult of Domesticity • Suffrage in western states • Jeanette Rankin • Elizabeth Cady Stanton • Susan B. Anthony • Carrie Chapman Catt • First proposal of Equal Rights Amendment • Flappers • League of Women Voters • National Woman’s Party • National American Woman Suffrage Association • Alice Paul • Lucy Stone • Ida B. Wells-Barnett • Ida Tarbell • IWW • WCTU • Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire • Jane Addams / Hull House • Margaret Sanger / Planned Parenthood • Woodrow Wilson • Eleanor Roosevelt • Great Depression Examples of using specific evidence to address the topic of the question: • “NAWSA and other groups — even some as radical as the IWW — were united, in part, by the ideal of Women’s Equality by means of women’s right to vote. NAWSA would later become much more conservative, whilst other figures, such as Alice Paul and Jane Addams, would remain progressive.” • “Although it did not happen in all states at once, states began to recognize the importance of women in the society. Starting in Wyoming, they were the first state to allow women the right to vote. More states followed in the coming years until it was noticed on a federal level.” Examples of unsuccessfully using evidence to address the topic of the question: • “In the time period right before the passing of the amendment, women were crucial to the Civil Rights movement. An example of this is Harriet Beecher Stowe’s “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” creating a wide-spread want for the end of slavery.” (The evidence presented in the response is outside of the time period delineated by the prompt.) • “In World War II more women than ever enlisted to serve America. Famously, Rosie the Riveter was used to attract women to enlist.” (The evidence presented in the response is outside the time period delineated by the prompt.) • “Due to the Nineteenth Amendment there was also greater participation in the government by women were as in the 1800’s women were basically excluded from politics. Many women gained seats in the government fighting for women’s rights. Many women became state governers.” (The generalization in the response about the effect of the Nineteenth Amendment is not historically accurate.) b) Using Evidence — Effective Substantiation Responses earn a separate point by utilizing specific examples of evidence to fully and effectively substantiate a thesis or relevant argument about the extent to which the Nineteenth Amendment marked a turning point in women’s lives in the United States (1 point). Fully and effectively substantiating the thesis goes beyond merely providing many examples. This point is earned by clearly and consistently linking significant evidence to the argument and showing how the evidence demonstrates the extent to which the Nineteenth Amendment marked a turning point in United States women’s history. Examples of utilizing evidence to substantiate an argument: • “Before the right to vote, in 1865-1920 a woman’s life was miserable. It was unpopular for women to work and those who did so worked in awful conditions. An example of this was the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire which killed many working women. While this event led to some reform, conditions were still bad. Pay was significantly lower than men’s and they were frowned upon by society to work. Instead, they were to raise families at home. Unmarried women especially found this hard.” (The response substantiates an argument that poor working conditions did not change as a result of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment.) • “Jobs were still largely restricted and they ended up voting very similar to their husbands, therefore not having enormous political impact. However, once the 1920’s rolled around women were doing unprecedented things such as becoming flappers with shorter clothing and attending speakeasies. Youth were experimenting more and sex was openly talked about. Sadly, this was quickly diminished with the onset of the Great Depression.” (The response substantiates an argument that the Nineteenth Amendment, at least for a period of time, marked both a political and social change for women.) Examples of unsuccessfully attempting to substantiate an argument with evidence: • “Due to the fact that they had been given a chance in politics, the election of the first female official in politics, Frances Perkins, was elected. This made a major difference in women’s lives because more women were encouraged to join politics.” (This response is too general and is inaccurate.) • “Secondly, the ratification of the nineteenth amendment led to the decreased belief of separate social spheres. The belief of separate social spheres was especially strong in the nineteenth century, and even more so in the South than in the North. But because of the ratification of the nineteenth amendment, this put women on a more even platform with men & they could now make their opinion heard.” (This response is too general to substantiate the argument.) D. Synthesis (1 point) Responses earn a point for synthesis by extending their arguments in one of two possible ways (1 point). a) Responses can extend their arguments by explaining the connections between their argument and a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area. These connections must consist of more than just a phrase or reference. Examples of synthesis by connecting the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area: • “The passage of the 19th amendment is similar to the passage of the 15th amendment for black men who gained the right to vote under it. It marked less of a turning point to them because while it did give them the right to vote, the KKK and other white supremacist groups attempted to prevent them from voting. While the 19th amendment was more of a turning point for women, the 15th amendment also marked a turning point for African American men in terms of voting rights.” • “Even years later, women were still subjugated in society. 1950s media depicted them as damsels in distress or caretakers of the husbands, and never as an independent entrepreneur. Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique details the false progress of women. She sought equal rights throughout society; however, the Equal Rights Act (ERA) she heavily supported never even passed. While the 19th Amendment did acknowledge women’s worth, it did not really alter their roles in society at all.” Examples that did not accurately connect the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area: • “The 19th Amendment marking a turning point in women’s history [that] can synthesize quite easily to African Americans and the act that allowed them to vote. Both African Americans and women had fought for equality and with these passings of their rights to vote they both were given the same basic rights as white male americans. Both movements fought for an incredibly long time and when they achieved what was fought for, it marked a huge turning point in their history and the opportunities they will have in the future.” (The general mention of African Americans and women in the response is insufficient to extend the argument.) • “After the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, women became a crucial part of United States history. Now, the presidential candidates had to also appeal to women, not just men. First Ladies such as Nancy Reagan waged a war on social issues (Nancy’s was drugs). Women became big parts of society that men could no longer ignore.” (The connection to the development in the response is too general to extend the argument.) b) Responses can extend their argument by explaining the connections between their argument and a course theme and/or approach to history that is not the focus of the essay (such as political, economic, social, cultural, or intellectual history). These connections must consist of more than just a phrase or reference. Example of synthesis by connecting the argument to a different course theme or approach to history: • “The women’s suffrage movement wasn’t the only group that had success in having their demands met. Labor unions in the Progressive era were also successful in achieving their goals through the work of groups like the AFL led by Samuel Gompers, or the IWW, they protested and ultimately forced the government to give in to their demands of better working conditions, shorter hours, higher wages, etc.” (The response gets the point for a connection to the theme of Work, Exchange and Technology.)
