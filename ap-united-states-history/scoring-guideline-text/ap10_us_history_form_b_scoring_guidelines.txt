James Elliot, Federalist, Vermont: The Constitution is silent on the subject of the acquisition of territory. By the treaty we acquire territory; therefore the treaty is unconstitutional. Samuel Thatcher, Federalist, Massachusetts: This acquisition of distant territory will involve the necessity of a considerable standing army, so justly an object of terror. Do gentlemen flatter themselves that by purchasing Louisiana, we are invulnerable? No, sir; Spain will still border on our southern frontier, and so long as Spain occupies that country we are not secure from the attempts of another nation more warlike and ambitious. William Plumer, Federalist, New Hampshire: Admit this western world into the union, and you destroy with a single operation the whole weight and importance of the eastern states. Document Information • Three northeastern members of the Federalist Party had grave doubts about the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. • These doubts stemmed from the observation that the federal Constitution does not authorize territorial acquisition, from a belief that the United States was no safer for having acquired this large territory, and from a fear that eastern states would become less important as the country expanded to the West. • The United States had just purchased Louisiana in 1803. • The U.S. Constitution does not mention ways in which the federal government may acquire territory. • As an immediate neighbor, Spain presented a real threat to the United States. • A standing army represented a threat. Document Inferences • The opponents of early American expansion were Federalists. • Opposition to expansion rested on several premises, including constitutional considerations, national security and self-interest. • Based on the revolutionary experience of the United States, there was good reason to oppose a standing army. Potential Outside Information Article I, Section 8 empire for liberty Livingston, Robert Bonaparte, Napoleon France loose construction Burr, Aaron Gulf of Mexico L’Ouverture, Toussaint Democrat-Republicans Haitian Revolution Mississippi River du Pont de Nemours, Pierre Jefferson, Thomas Monroe, James Samuel Lewis and Clark expedition New Orleans Question 1 — Document Information and Inferences (continued) Document A (continued)  Northern Confederacy  right of deposit  states’ rights  Pickering, Timothy  Rocky Mountains  strict construction  Pinckney’s Treaty  Rupert’s Land  Talleyrand  Republican Party  Sauk  Treaty of San Ildefonso  AP® UNITED STATES HISTORY 2010 SCORING GUIDELINES (Form B) Question 1 — Document Information and Inferences (continued) Document B Document Information • The U.S. House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly for war on June 4, 1812. • More than two-thirds of the House of Representatives voted for war on June 4, 1812, with most of the supporters coming from the South and West and most opponents coming from the Northeast, along with some from Virginia and Maryland. Question 1 — Document Information and Inferences (continued) Document B (continued) • All the congressmen from Pennsylvania, Georgia and South Carolina and from west of the Appalachian Mountains (Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee) voted for war. Document Inferences • In this “Second War for Independence,” the United States went to war with Britain in 1812, chiefly to force the British out of U.S. territory and thus clear the way for American expansion. • The British had never respected American sovereignty over the area all the way to the Mississippi River, which was called for in the Treaty of Paris that ended the American Revolution. Potential Outside Information Battle of Horseshoe Bend Hull, William Old Ironsides Battle of New Orleans impressment Orders in Council Battle of Plattsburgh Iroquois Perry, Oliver Battle of Queenstown Heights Jackson, Andrew Pinckney’s Treaty Battle of the Thames Key, Francis Scott privateering burning of Washington Lafitte, Jean Rule of 1756 Calhoun, John C.

Their moral and their intellectual condition have been equally stationary. And in the whole circle of their existence, it would be difficult to point to a single advantage which they have derived from their acquaintance with the Europeans. All this is without a parallel in the history of the world. That it is not to be attributed to the indifference or neglect of the whites, we have already shown. There must then be an inherent difficulty, arising from the institutions, character, and condition of the Indians themselves. Document Information • In an 1829 report on American aborigines, Lewis Cass expressed a belief that the Cherokee Nation had made no progress in improving its society despite 200 years of “contact with a civilized people.” • This lack of improvement, Cass maintained, was the direct result of the Cherokee refusal to change and was the first such instance in world history in which a group considered to be inferior did not benefit from associating with a civilization considered to be more advanced. • Cass argued that this lack of improvement could not be laid at the feet of Europeans but must be attributed to an inherently inferior civilization. White Americans regarded native peoples, including the Cherokee, as inferior and blamed them for their inferior position because they had not benefited from close contact with Europeans. Document Inferences • The author of this document, Lewis Cass, was a brigadier general in the War of 1812, a longtime governor of the Michigan Territory and negotiator of the Treaty of Fort Miegs with Indian tribes. • As Andrew Jackson’s secretary of war, Cass was a central figure in the formulation and implementation of Indian removal. Cass would also support Texas annexation. • In addition, Americans had a long history of mistreating American Indians. Potential Outside Information American Indian leaders Five Civilized Tribes Oklahoma Cherokee Nation v.

By 1837, 46,000 Native Americans had been removed from their homelands, which opened 25 million acres for white settlement. Potential Outside Information Black Hawk Cass, Lewis (secretary of war) Cherokee Nation v.

Calhoun, address to Congress on Mexico, 1848. We are anxious to force free government on all; and I see that it has been urged in a very respectable quarter, that it is the mission of this country to spread civil and religious liberty over the entire world, and especially over this continent. It is a great mistake. None but people advanced to a very high state of moral and intellectual improvement are capable, in a civilized state, of maintaining free government; and amongst those who are so purified, very few, indeed, have had the good fortune of forming a constitution capable of endurance. Document Information • In an address to Congress in 1848, Senator John C. Calhoun criticized the contention of respectable people that every nation could sustain democratic government. • Not every people, he maintained, possessed sufficient development in moral and intellectual terms to support political liberty. Document Inferences • Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, a former War Hawk before the War of 1812 and later a secretary of state and vice president, questioned the wisdom of the Mexican War and abstained when the authorization vote for war came. • After the United States thrashed Mexico and debated the prospect of extending its border all the way to Guatemala, Calhoun denounced the idea as fundamentally changing the character of American society. • The acquisition of Mexico would compel the United States to adopt what Calhoun was convinced was a doomed experiment — a truly multiracial society of the kind that had allegedly dragged down the Spanish in Latin America. • Calhoun believed that some peoples, especially Mexicans, were incapable of replicating the American experiment in liberty. • Calhoun noted that the United States had either pushed Indian nations into the wilderness or allowed them separate spheres. • Better, Calhoun thought, to be satisfied with acquiring a largely uninhabited block of land called the Mexican Cession, which is exactly what Congress agreed to in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Potential Outside Information Adams, John Quincy Battle of Buena Vista Battle of Monterrey Battle of Vera Cruz Bear Flag Revolt Compromise of 1850 Democratic Party filibustering Kearny, Stephen Lincoln, Abraham Lowell, Robert Mexican Cession Mr. Polk’s War Nicaragua Nueces River Rio Grande Scott, Winfield spot resolutions Taylor, Zachary Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo Trist, Nicholas Walker, William Wilmot, David Wilmot Proviso AP® UNITED STATES HISTORY 2010 SCORING GUIDELINES (Form B) Question 1 — Document Information and Inferences (continued) Document I Source: Henry David Thoreau, Civil Disobedience, 1849. The government itself, which is only the mode which the people have chosen to execute their will, is equally liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it. Witness the present Mexican War, the work of comparatively a few individuals using the standing government as their tool; for, in the outset, the people would not have consented to this measure. Document Information • In Civil Disobedience, which was written in 1849, Henry David Thoreau warned of governmental abuse in the absence of a functioning democracy, mentioning as a prime example the unpopular Mexican War. Document Inferences • This classic essay against governmental power, which was originally entitled Resistance to Civil Government, reflected transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau’s opposition to military force and to slavery, both of which were issues in the Mexican War that the United States had prosecuted in the late 1840s. • When a tax collector demanded that Thoreau pay his poll tax, Thoreau refused because, he noted, taxes finance injustice, including what he regarded as America’s unprovoked war with Mexico to enable slave expansion. • He was briefly jailed for his antitax stance until his aunt bailed him out. Potential Outside Information Emerson, Ralph Waldo nonresistants transcendentalists Lincoln, Abraham pacifists Whig Party Mr. Polk’s War spot resolutions Wilmot Proviso AP® UNITED STATES HISTORY 2010 SCORING GUIDELINES (Form B) Question 1 — Document Information and Inferences (continued) Document J Source: Ostend Manifesto, 1854. [B]y every law, human and divine, we shall be justified in wresting [Cuba] from Spain if we possess the power; and this upon the very same principle that would justify an individual in tearing down the burning house of his neighbor if there were no other means of preventing the flames from destroying his own home. Under such circumstances we ought neither to count the cost nor regard the odds which Spain might enlist against us. Document Information • According to the Ostend Manifesto, the United States had every right to take Cuba from Spain. Document Inferences • American expansionists, such as Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, had long coveted Cuba, particularly as a slave state, once California was made a free state under the Compromise of 1850. • The only limitation worth considering was military might: Did the United States possess the raw power to force Spain out of Cuba? • Although the Ostend Manifesto was never acted upon, the United States remained interested in Cuba, particularly after the American Civil War ended — an interest that ultimately led to Cuban independence. Potential Outside Information Adams, John Quincy Fillmore, Millard Polk, James K.

Jesuit and Franciscan missionaries established isolated Catholic missions where they imposed Christianity on the Native Americans. After 10 years missions were secularized, lands were divided among converted Indians, the mission chapel became the parish church, and the inhabitants were given full Spanish citizenship (had to pay taxes). Soldiers sent to protect the missions lived in presidios (forts); their families and accompanying merchants, in adjacent villages. Those who did not accept the requerimiento (freedom to all Native Americans who accepted Spanish authority) were threatened with war and enslavement. In reality Spanish colonial society, while extremely Catholic, was very stratified. conquistadors missions, missionaries, conversions, presidios encomiendas/encomendero New Laws (1542) Ginés de Sepúlveda, Juan Popé revolt (Pueblo) in New Mexico (1680) Juan de Onate colonizes New Mexico for Spain reconquest of New Mexico (1699) (1598) requerimiento (1513) Las Casas, Bartolomé de Santa Fe established (1610) Laws of Burgos (1513) Spanish settlement established in Albuquerque mestizo (1706) New France New France differed greatly from the Spanish and English settlements. Most settlements in New France were predominantly male and much smaller in number. The smaller numbers required the French to develop cooperative relationships with the Native Americans. The French, unlike the English, established trading outposts rather than farms, and on land not claimed by Native Americans. This resulted in no initial hostility. The French also served as mediators among Great Lakes tribes. This diplomatic role gave them much more local authority and influence than their English counterparts. The outnumbered and disproportionately male French settlers sought to integrate themselves with Native American culture rather than eliminate it. This more fraternal bond proved a source of strength in the wars with the English. A source of wealth was the fur trade; however, the charter limited the population to French Catholics only. In 1663 New France became a royal colony under Louis XIV. While the fur trade fueled the economy and peopling of New France, the activities of Catholic missionaries gave New France its dynamism. Like Spain, New France was aggressive in converting Native Americans, but in New France the Jesuits did the conversion work. Unlike the Spanish, the Jesuits were rarely accompanied by soldiers, and they did not require Native American converts to move to missions. The Jesuits lived among the Native Americans, and they borrowed from each other’s ways. The Native Americans may have converted, but they never embraced Jesuit teaching and learning. This approach enabled New France to prosper and its settlers to spread deep into Canada and as far south as Louisiana. Cartier, Jacques (three trips for French Franciscans, e.g., Louis Hennepin exploration, 1534–1542) French settlers arrive in New France (1614) Champlain, Samuel de (began exploration of Jesuits, e.g., Jacques Marquette Quebec, 1608) New France becomes a royal colony (1663) Question 2 — Information List (continued) New England Religious fundamentalists who looked to the Bible for authority and inspiration, the Puritans came to New England to purify the church and to create a successful community within the parameters of their religious beliefs. With the exception of religion, moderation was the key. As a result of their experiences in Britain, they wanted a separation of church and state, but in New England only church members could vote and therefore the state supported the church. From this an assembly of true Christians could enter into a church covenant, a voluntary union for the common worship of God. Hence it was only a short step to the idea of a voluntary union for the purpose of government (e.g., the Mayflower Compact, the charter of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, and the informal Rhode Island arrangement prior to securing a charter in 1663). To question state authority, however, was to question belief in the Bible and as such was not be tolerated (e.g., Anne Hutchinson, Roger Williams/Rhode Island, Thomas Hooker/Connecticut, John Mason/New Hampshire). Growth strains led to the Halfway Covenant in 1662. In 1691 Massachusetts became a royal colony, which required religious toleration of dissenters and made the right to vote based on property rather than on church membership. The Salem Witch Trials of 1692 highlighted the transition from a Puritan-based society to a royal crown colony. The trials have also been seen as an attack on women who did not accept their place in society. Edwards, Jonathan (“Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,” 1741) Eliot, John (the “Indian apostle”); American Indian praying towns Good, Sarah Great Awakening (1734) Halfway Covenant (1662) Hutchinson, Anne (exiled with followers, 1637) Massachusetts Bay Colony (1629) Massachusetts establishes system of public education (1647); “ye olde deluder Satan” act Massachusetts and New Hampshire made royal colonies (1692) Mather, Cotton New Haven (1638) Osborne, Sarah Parris, Samuel Pilgrims found Plymouth Colony (1620); first Thanksgiving Plymouth Colony absorbed into Massachusetts (1691) Rhode Island Charter (1644) Salem Witch Trials (1692) Tituba Whitfield, George (first sermon in America — Philadelphia, 1739) Williams, Roger (exiled from Massachusetts, 1636) Winthrop, John (“city upon a hill”) Question 3 Compare and contrast the experience of slaves on tobacco plantations in the early seventeenth-century Chesapeake region with that of slaves on nineteenth-century cotton plantations in the Deep South.

The Lower South included South Carolina and Georgia. Following the introduction of the cotton gin and the cotton explosion throughout the Cotton Belt or Black Belt, the nineteenth-century “Deep South” or “King Cotton South” expanded into the area from Alabama to Texas through Missouri and Arkansas. The states of the Deep South were Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas. Tobacco Plantations — Chesapeake Establishment of Slavery • First slaves arrived in the English mainland colonies. • They were treated as indentured servants. • As late as 1690 they numbered only about 2,000 in Virginia (out of a total population of 35,000). • The supply of European indentured servants to the Chesapeake dried up just as more Africans were becoming available. • The four decades following 1700 saw the heaviest importation of slaves into the Chesapeake and Carolina regions. • Between 1700 and 1750 Virginia planters imported about 45,000 slaves. • The black population increased during these years from perhaps 10,000 to over 100,000. In 1680 only 7 percent of Virginia’s population was African in origin, but by 1700 the proportion had increased to 28 percent and half the labor force was enslaved. Legal Foundations • During the early period there was no clear legal definition of slavery in the mainland colonies. • In the seventeenth century African slavery and white and African servitude existed side by side, and laws to enforce slavery appeared piecemeal. • The first Virginia law recognizing slavery was passed in 1661. • In 1705 Virginia passed a comprehensive slave code that became a model for other colonies. • As long as the black population remained small, the color line was blurry. • In the late seventeenth century laws were passed restricting the freedom of black people, and slavery became institutionalized and recognized by law. Working Conditions • On small plantations and farms, typical in the tobacco country of the Chesapeake, Africans sometimes worked side by side with their owners. • Tobacco plantations were larger and closer to one another than were rice plantations. The size and proximity of tobacco plantations permitted slaves more frequent contact with friends and relatives. • Many Chesapeake slaves, like those in the Lower South, were African born, but most lived on smaller plantations with fewer than 20 fellow slaves. • Chesapeake slaves also had more contact with whites. Chesapeake masters actively managed their estates and subjected their slaves to closer scrutiny. • Most Chesapeake slaves lived in units consisting of mother, father and small children. • In some cases, fathers were married away from their own plantations and visited “broad wives” and children during their off hours. Question 3 — Information List (continued) • Tobacco, the dominant crop in the Chesapeake region, required oversight, so planters organized slaves into gangs that worked together under the watchful eye of a white overseer or black slave driver. • By 1720 the proportion of females in the Chesapeake slave population had begun to rise, making family life possible. • By the 1730s the slave population of the Chesapeake had become the first in the Western Hemisphere to achieve self-sustained growth. Changes in the Late Seventeenth Century • Planters were increasingly fearful by rebellions of former indentured servants. • By the mid-1680s, for the first time, black slaves outnumbered white servants among the plantation colonies’ new arrivals. • In 1698 Royal African Company lost its monopoly on slave trade and the supply of slaves increased sharply. More than 10,000 Africans came to America in the decade after 1700. • Blacks were nearly half the population of Virginia by 1750. • Earlier in the seventeenth century there was no clear legal difference between a slave and a servant. But in the late seventeenth century the law began to make sharp distinctions between the two, primarily on the basis of race. New statutes or “slave codes” made black people and their children the property (or “chattels”) of white slaveholders for life. • Beginning in the 1680s Virginia statues referred to people of English descent as “white” rather than as “Christian.” End of the Old South • In 1790 the future of slavery was uncertain in the Chesapeake. The tobacco market had been precarious since before the Revolution and continued to decline after 1790. • With slave labor becoming less necessary, Chesapeake planters continued to switch to grain and livestock — which required less labor than tobacco — and tried to think up new uses for slaves. Some planters divided their land into small plots and rented both the plots and slaves to white tenant farmers. Others, particularly in Maryland, recruited tenants from the growing ranks of free blacks. Still others hired out their slaves as artisans and urban laborers. • Many began to free their slaves. In Virginia free blacks increased from 4 percent in 1790 to 7 percent by 1810. • Thousands of blacks from the soil-exhausted slave states of the Old South, especially tobacco-depleted Virginia, were sent as field-gang laborers to the cotton frontier of the lower Mississippi Valley. • The interstate trade involved an estimated 600,000 to 700,000 slaves over the period 1815–1860. • Virginia planters found their slaves newly valuable, which led to slave breeding. Cotton Plantations — Deep South • The first major cotton-producing regions were inland areas of Georgia and South Carolina, but the center of production shifted rapidly westward during the nineteenth century, first to Alabama and Mississippi and then to Arkansas, northwestern Louisiana and eastern Texas. • By 1820 the cotton boom extended slavery into the territory south of Pennsylvania and the Ohio River Valley and east of the Mississippi River, as well as into Missouri and Louisiana. • Slaves in the low country of South Carolina and Georgia lived on large plantations with as many as 50 other black workers and had infrequent contact with either their masters or the rest of the sparse white population. Question 3 — Information List (continued) • Of the 1.5 million enslaved inhabitants of the South in 1820, probably three-quarters lived on plantations • The typical (cotton) plantation had 20 to 50 slaves and 800 to 1,000 acres of land. • Slavery remained a highly profitable investment. The average slaveholder spent perhaps $30 to $35 a year to support an adult slave. A planter could expect one of his slaves to produce more than $78 worth of cotton. • By 1860 most slaves were concentrated in the “Black Belt” of the Deep South that stretched from South Carolina and Georgia into the new southwest states of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. • In South Carolina and Georgia, rice remained a major crop, but from 1780 to 1810 a switch was made from indigo as the second crop to cotton. During the period 1788 to 1808 some 250,000 slaves were brought from Africa, almost all into Charleston and Savannah. Changes in the Eighteenth Century • By 1775 one out of every five Americans was of African ancestry, and more than 90 percent of all black Americans lived in the South, most along the seaboard on tobacco and rice plantations. • Legal importation of African slaves into the United States ended in 1808. • Although slavery was a national institution in 1776, by 1820 it was confined to the states south of Pennsylvania and the Ohio River. • In the aftermath of the American Revolution, most northern states gradually abolished slavery. Slavery in the Nineteenth Century • After the middle of the eighteenth century a number of changes led to the growth of black families and created vibrant slave communities. As slave importations began to taper off, the rate of natural reproduction among blacks started to climb, and the ratio of men to women became more equal. • By 1860 there were nearly four million black slaves in the South. Their numbers had quadrupled since 1800. The majority of the increase came from natural reproduction. • The United States was the only slave society in the Americas where the slave population increased naturally — at about the same rate as the white population. • Planters invested nearly $2 billion of their capital into slaves by 1860. • Larger slaveholders usually owned several plantations, with an overseer to manage the slaves. • The conditions slaves encountered varied widely, depending on the size of the farm or plantation, the crop being grown, the personality of the master and whether he was an absentee owner. • On the large plantations, slave women worked as seamstresses, cooks, nurses or maids in the master’s house. • Slave men worked as butlers, coachmen and valets. Besides working in the fields, they might serve as drivers, skilled mechanics or craftsmen. • House servants and the drivers, who supervised the field hands, had the highest status, and skilled artisans such as carpenters and blacksmiths were also given special recognition. The hardest work was done by the field hands, both men and women, who sometimes were divided into plow hands and hoe gangs. • Some plantations had the gang system, in which a white overseer or black driver supervised gangs of 20 to 25 adults. The gang system was widely used in the cotton districts. • Other plantations had the task system, whereby each slave was given a specific daily assignment to complete, after which he or she was finished for the day. This was most common in rice fields. This system allowed slaves to work at their own pace, gave them an incentive to do careful work and freed the overseers from having to closely supervise the work. Question 3 — Information List (continued) • Slaves were in the field 15–16 hours a day. Work was uncommon on Sundays and frequently involved only a half day on Saturday. Rough cheap cloth was distributed for clothing once a year, enough to make a couple of outfits, and one pair of shoes. Sickness was a persistent problem. On average planters spent less than a dollar a year on medical care for slaves. • About 5 percent of slaves worked in industry in the South, including mills, ironworks and railroad building. • Slaves in cities took on a wider range of jobs than did plantation slaves — as porters, waiters, cooks and skilled laborers in tradesmen’s shops — and in general enjoyed more autonomy. Slave Resistance • To resist, slaves abused machinery, mishandled animals, broke tools, lost items, worked carelessly, feigned illness or stole items. • They also slowed the pace of work, fostering a myth of black “laziness.” • Slave revolts included those by Gabriel Prosser (Richmond, 1800), Denmark Vesey (Charleston, 1822) and Nat Turner (Virginia, 1831). • Denmark Vesey was a free black of Charleston who belonged to the African Methodist church. In 1822 he planned to take over the armory, but Gullah Jack, a conjurer, spread word of the plan and Vesey, Jack and 34 others were hung. Slave Families • Maintaining a sense of family was one of the most remarkable achievements of black people in bondage. • Masters often found it advantageous to encourage strong marriage ties among their slaves as it reduced rivalries and made for a more efficient workforce. • Southern laws did not recognize slave marriages as legally binding. • The traditional nuclear family of father, mother and children was the rule, not the exception. • Slaves developed strong kinship networks; aunts and uncles were expected to look after children in an extended network of mutual obligation. • On large plantations with relatively stable slave populations, a substantial majority of slave children lived in two-parent households, and many marriages lasted for as long as 20–30 years. • In areas where most slaves lived on farms or small plantations, especially in the Upper South, the trading and hiring out of slaves frequently took place. Slaves often had spouses who resided on other plantations or farms, even some distance away, and ties between husbands and wives were looser and more fragile. The result was that female-headed families in these areas were the norm, and responsibility for child rearing was vested in mothers, assisted in most cases by female relatives and friends. Slave Religion • Slaveholders encouraged religion as an effective means of social control. Most slaves sought Christianity on their own, beyond the control of the master. • Slave preachers, conjurers and herb doctors held status that no white conferred. • After 1830 most of the southern states outlawed black preachers, but the laws could not be enforced. • Blacks were attracted to the enthusiastic Protestantism of Baptists and Methodists, though they never fully accepted the Protestant emphasis on guilt. Question 3 — Information List (continued) Contrasts • The tobacco and rice planters of the Atlantic Tidewater were part of a settled region and a culture that reached back 150 to 200 years. States such as Mississippi and Arkansas, in contrast, were at or just emerging from the frontier stage, since most of their residents had arrived after 1815. Consequently, the society of the Southwest was more volatile. • In Chesapeake Bay the economy was built around tobacco. Virginia planters tended to buy more black women from Africa than did rice planters, in order to cheaply increase their supply of slaves through childbearing. This in turn allowed for healthier and more vigorous family life among Chesapeake Bay slaves, who in any event were freer of sickness because they did not work in disease-ridden swamps and in large gangs, where contagious diseases spread rapidly. The Virginia slaves therefore flourished through natural increase in a fashion strikingly different from that farther south. • The movement of slaves out of the Chesapeake was immense. In the 1790s about 1 in 12 Virginia and Maryland slaves was taken south and west. The figure rose to 1 in 10 between 1800 and 1810, and 1 in 5 between 1810 and 1820. In 1790 planters in Virginia and Maryland had owned 56 percent of all American slaves; by 1860 they owned only 15 percent. • Nineteenth-century slaves were not evenly distributed throughout the region. More than half lived in the Deep South, where blacks outnumbered whites in both South Carolina and Mississippi by the 1850s. Elsewhere in the Deep South, the black population exceeded 40 percent in all states except Texas. In the Upper South, on the other hand, whites greatly outnumbered blacks. Only in Virginia and North Carolina did the slave population top 30 percent. • A majority of blacks in the Deep South lived on larger plantations that had communities of 20 or more slaves. There the family life of slaves tended to be relatively stable, and a distinctive African American slave culture developed. Forced separations of spouses and of parents and children were evidently more common on smaller plantations and in the Upper South. • Slaves living on farms or small plantations no doubt had closer contact with the white owners and their families. They often ate at the same table with the master and sometimes even slept in the same cabin. But slaves who lived in such close quarters with their owners were constantly subject to white scrutiny, always made aware of their inferior social status and had less opportunity to meet other blacks. In addition, small farmers were more likely to run into financial problems and be forced to sell their slaves. • Slaves under the task system (common on South Carolina and Georgia rice and cotton plantations) won the right to cultivate land as “private fields” — not the little garden plots common in the Chesapeake, but farms of up to five acres on which they grew produce and raised livestock for market. A lively trade developed in slave-produced goods, and by the late 1850s slaves in the low country not only produced and exchanged property but also passed it on to their children. Transformational Forces • Attitudes toward slavery rapidly changed in the South following the invention of the cotton gin in 1793. White Southerners forced slaves to work at the pace required in the cotton fields in order to turn high profits. • Planters in the Upper South regularly sold their surplus slaves to cotton and sugar planters in the Deep South. The demand in the Deep South drove prices up so that by the later 1850s a prime field hand, who would have sold for $600 in the early 1840s, commanded $1,500. • From the 1830s onward, after the Denmark Vesey conspiracy and Nat Turner’s Rebellion, the Southern states sharply reversed an earlier trend toward manumissions and the weakening of slavery in its legal definition. In these states, manumissions were almost impossible, and free blacks were either driven out or placed under strict controls. Question 3 — Information List (continued) • Southern whites sought to make slavery more humane, hoping to prevent insurrections. • In every decade after 1820 at least 150,000 slaves were uprooted either by slave trading or planter migration to new areas, and in the expansions of the 1830s and the 1850s the number reached a quarter of a million. • Between 1820 and 1860 nearly 50 percent of the slave population of the Upper South was a part of the southern expansion. Terms/Data big house Black Belt black ivory breakers (harsh owners/drivers) Brear Rabbit broad wives (wives on other plantations) “Can see to can’t see” (work from sunup to sundown) cotton gin Cotton Belt Equiano, Olaudah (former slave and author of The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, 1789) gang system Geechee (slave language of sea islands, corruption of Gizzis peoples of Africa) ”goober,” “gumbo,” “voodoo” come from Gullah Gullah (slave language of sea islands, corruption of Angola) hush harbors (slave religious practice centers) Johnson, William (the “barber of Natchez,” mulatto slave owner in New Orleans) paternalism (master attitude) “patting juba” (slapping thighs in musical elements) peculiar institution Posser, Gabriel (1800) responsorial style (religious services) “Second Middle Passage” (internal migration of 19th century) spirituals (“Steal Away to Jesus,” “Canaan, Sweet Canaan,” “Go Down Moses,” “Cross over Jordan”) slave codes slave pens (collection areas for slaves being sold internally) “Sold down the river” stinking weed Stono Rebellion (Stono Bridge, South Carolina, 1739) task system Turner, Nat (1831) Vesey, Denmark (1822) “Until death or distance do you part” (slave wedding vow) Whitney, Eli Question 4 Analyze the effectiveness of Progressive Era reformers in addressing problems of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
