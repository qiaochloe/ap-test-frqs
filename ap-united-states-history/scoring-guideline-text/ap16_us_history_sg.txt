Demographic concentration of immigrants in northeastern cities. • Growing nativist (anti-immigration) movement in the United States. • Anti-Catholic movement. • Concerns about ethnic enclaves and political power of immigrants. • Formation of political parties that had a nativist platform (e.g., Know-Nothings) while other parties sought to capitalize on immigrant vote, in particular urban Democrats in New York City and Boston. • Immigrants became the labor force that built the canals and antebellum regional railroads, and they helped shaped the infrastructure of the country. • Immigration increased divisions between the North and the South: North and Upper Midwest characterized by free, immigrant labor while South and Southwest by enslaved labor. • Immigration helped shape a new national culture. • Immigrants created their own ethnic cultures within the United States. • Irish and German consumption and production of beer and wine contributed to early temperance activism. Short Answer Question 2  Answer (a), (b), and (c).  a) Briefly explain ONE important similarity between the goals of the Spanish and the English in establishing colonies

or Spanish crowns • To promote religion  • To find access to Asia  b) Briefly explains ONE important difference between the goals of the Spanish and the English in establishing colonies.   Short Answer Question 2 (continued)  Examples of responses to (b) that would earn the point:  • Spanish:  o More intent on religious proselytizing (spread Catholicism) o More interested in glory (power of Spanish Crown) o More openly interested in achieving individual fame and glory of conquistadores o More interested in establishing and protecting trade networks and routes o Colonization more directed by central government  • English:  o Pursued a wider range of goals, including religious settlement and economic gain (e.g., extractive industries and farming/fishing/forests/fur) o More willing to allow bases for privateers o More motivated by imperial competition with Spain and other nations o More likely to be fleeing from political and religious conflicts  c) Briefly explains ONE way in which the difference indicated in (b) contributed to a difference in the development of Spanish and English colonial societies.  Examples of responses to (c) that would earn the point:  • England more likely to allow private individuals and joint stock companies to colonize in the name of England. • Spanish developed extractive industries in precious metals, whereas English were more likely to establish economies based on trade. • More royal control over Spanish colonies than English because English were settled to escape political and religious persecution. • Many English colonists tended to establish more permanent settlements than did conquistadores. However, the Spanish eventually established permanent settlements. • Because Spaniards were more concerned with conversion, they eventually integrated indigenous peoples into their culture, albeit not equally. • English were more concerned with excluding indigenous peoples from colonial society so they were more likely to dislocate them from their lands. • English were more willing to embrace diverse labor systems (indentured servants, enslaved African Americans). • The encomienda system developed as a Spanish labor system, which also reinforced efforts to instill Catholic religious practices in Native Americans. • The English developed diverse labor systems (indentured servants, enslaved African Americans).    Short Answer Question 3  “They were aggressive men, as were the first feudal barons; sometimes they were lawless; in important crises, nearly all of them tended to act without those established moral principles which fixed more or less the conduct of the common people of the community. . . . These men were robber barons as were their medieval counterparts, the dominating figures of an aggressive economic age. . . . Under their hands, the renovation of our economic life proceeded relentlessly; large-scale production replaced the scattered, decentralized mode of production; industrial enterprises became more concentrated, more ‘efficient’ technically, and essentially ‘cooperative,’ where they had been purely individualistic and lamentably wasteful.” Matthew Josephson, historian, 1934  “What really lifted the giants above the rest was the ability to envision where the world, or their part of it, was going, and to act on that vision in a creative ways. . . . From the days of Adam Smith, self-interest has been the acknowledged driving force of capitalism; the secret of the market system is that one person’s self-interest can simultaneously serve the interests of others. Buyers and sellers, producers and consumers, investors and entrepreneurs take reciprocal advantage of each other. Success rewards those who can discover or create areas of reciprocity; the larger the area, the greater the success. . . . They were captains of industry; but like officers of volunteer regiments, they held their posts at the sufferance of those they led.” H. W. Brands, historian, 1999  Using the excerpts, answer (a), (b), and (c).  a) Briefly explain ONE major difference between Josephson’s and Brands’s historical interpretations of business leaders who rose to prominence between 1865 and 1900. b) Briefly explain how ONE person, event, or development from the period 1865–1900 that is not explicitly mentioned in the excerpts could be used to support Josephson’s interpretation. c) Briefly explain how ONE person, event, or development from the period 1865–1900 that is not explicitly mentioned in the excerpts could be used to support Brands’s interpretation.  Scoring Guide  0–3 points   Score 3  Response accomplishes all three tasks set by the question.   Score 2  Response accomplishes two of the tasks set by the question.   Score 1  Response accomplishes one of the tasks set by the question.   Score 0  Response accomplishes none of the tasks set by the question.   Score NR Is completely blank   Short Answer Question 3 (continued)  Scoring Notes  a) Briefly explains ONE major difference between Josephson’s and Brands’s historical interpretations of business leaders who rose to prominence between 1865 and 1900.  Examples of responses to (a) that would earn the point: • Josephson argues that industrial leaders succeeded through immoral actions but in doing so consolidated businesses and made capitalist production more efficient. • Brands argues that capitalist self-interest was beneficial not only to industrial leaders themselves but also to people around them and business in general. • Brands argues that industrial leaders were captains of industry and that they consolidated industry, which he sees as socially and economically beneficial.  b) Briefly explains how ONE person, event, or development from the period 1865–1900 not explicitly mentioned in the excerpts could be used to support Josephson’s interpretation.  Examples of responses to (b) that would earn the point: • Examples of exploitative consolidation by individuals such as Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, J. P. Morgan, Jay Gould, Cornelius Vanderbilt, etc. • First efforts to regulate trusts were the Interstate Commerce Commission (1887) and the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (1890) • Use of Social Darwinism or Gospel of Wealth to justify great wealth for some • Periods of boom and bust in the economy  • Use of antitrust legislation to support corporations and sometimes to repress organized labor • Organization of a labor movement to oppose robber barons; outbreak of strikes, some nationwide • Use of federal and militia forces to put down labor strikes and protests • Rise of the Populists, the Progressives, muckrakers, labor unions, and radical socialists and communists, all evidence of those seeking to redress growing inequities in the system • Corrupt political influence to serve economic self-interest (e.g., political machine and Boss Tweed)  • Evidence of growing inequities in industrial America (cheap labor, little regulation, slums, tenements, etc., as evidence of poverty versus the appearance of the first millionaires and conspicuous consumption as evidence of wealth)  c) Briefly explains how ONE person, event, or development from the period 1865–1900 not explicitly mentioned in the excerpts could be used to support Brands’s interpretation.  Examples of responses to (c) that would earn the point: • Benefits brought by industrial and managerial capital: national markets; transportation and communications networks; innovations in industry, production, commerce, and finance; technological innovations; in many instances, falling prices for goods produced more efficiently and cheaply. • Overall standard of living and wealth (Gross Domestic Product or GDP) in the United States continues to rise; immigrants stream into the United States, attracted to opportunity. • The United States becomes the industrial and economic engine of the world economy, which continues for much of the 20th century. • Henry Ford may be included in an exemplary list of industrialists within the time period who fit Brand’s interpretation; however, used alone, Ford is outside the time period. • The Gospel of Wealth as evidence of using wealth for the greater good Short Answer Question 3 (continued)  • Inspirational elements of upward mobility evident in Horatio Alger’s rags-to-riches stories  • Consumers benefit from industrial and technological innovation, efficiency, and production  NOTE: it would be acceptable for test-takers to use some of the same examples (e.g., Andrew Carnegie, vertical/horizontal integration) to respond to both (b) and (c), as long as they explain how the example supports both interpretations. Short Answer Question 4  Answer (a), (b), and (c).  a) Identify ONE factor that increased tensions between Great Britain and its North American colonies in the period 1763–1776, and briefly explain how this factor helped lead to the American Revolution. b) Identify a SECOND distinct factor that increased tensions between Great Britain and its North American colonies in the same period, and briefly explain how this factor helped lead to the American Revolution. c) Identify a THIRD distinct factor that increased tensions between Great Britain and its North American colonies in the same period, and briefly explain how this factor helped lead to the American Revolution.  Scoring Guide  0–3 points   Score 3  Response accomplishes all three tasks set by the question.   Score 2  Response accomplishes two of the tasks set by the question.   Score 1  Response accomplishes one of the tasks set by the question.   Score 0  Response accomplishes none of the tasks set by the question.   Score NR Is completely blank   Scoring Notes  Responses should identify THREE distinct factors that increased tensions between Great Britain and its North American colonies in the period 1763–1776 AND briefly explain how each factor helped lead to the American Revolution.  Note: This question type assesses causation; thus it must include cause (event or historical development) and effect (increased tensions that lead to American Revolution) relationships in a historical context.  Note: Reward responses displaying sound knowledge of historical context. Identifying factors without explaining their effects will not earn points, but avoid penalizing those responses that employ similar explanations for more than one factor. Factors may be arranged in chronological sequence but are not required to be.   Short Answer Question 4 (continued)  Examples of responses that would earn the points: • Britain’s debt from the French and Indian War led it to try to consolidate control over its colonies and raise revenue through direct taxation (e.g., Stamp Act, Townshend Acts, Tea Act, and Intolerable Acts), generating tensions between Great Britain and its North American colonies. • Colonists resented the end of “salutary neglect,” the curtailment of self-government, and inability to set taxation policy (“no taxation without representation”). • Colonial organizations (e.g., Sons of Liberty) and publications (e.g., Common Sense) created structure for revolutionary activity. • Colonial confrontations (e.g., Boston Massacre and Boston Tea Party) exacerbated tensions. • Military participation in the French and Indian War not only provided military experience but also established Americans’ sense of themselves as an independent people. • Westward population movement provoked British restrictions (Proclamation of 1763) as well as discontent with those restrictions. • The Enlightenment inspired rethinking of concepts, such as rights of individuals, the rights of British subjects, and republican self-government. • Intercolonial connections strengthened earlier in the 18th century (e.g., print culture, proliferation of newspapers and pamphlets, Great Awakening) served the independence movement between 1763 and 1776. Question 1 – Document-Based Question  Explain the causes of the rise of women’s rights movement in the period 1940–1975.  Maximum Possible Points: 7  Please note: • Each point of the rubric is earned independently, e.g. a student could earn the point for argument development without earning the point for thesis. • Unique evidence from the student response is required to earn each point, e.g. evidence in the student response that qualifies for the contextualization point could not be used to earn the point for synthesis or the point for sourcing the documents.   A.  Thesis and Argument Development (2 points)    Targeted Skill: Argumentation (E1, E4, and C1) 1 point Presents a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim and responds to all parts of the question. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion.  Scoring Note: Neither the introduction nor the conclusion is necessarily limited to a single paragraph.  1 point  Develops and supports a cohesive argument that recognizes and accounts for historical complexity by explicitly illustrating relationships among historical evidence such as contradiction, corroboration, and/or qualification.   0 points Neither presents a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim and responds to all parts of the question nor develops and supports a cohesive argument that recognizes and accounts for historical complexity.  --  Is completely blank  B.  Document Analysis (2 points)   Targeted Skill: Analyzing Evidence: Content and Sourcing (A1 and A2) and Argumentation (E2) 1 point Utilizes the content of at least six of the documents to support the stated thesis or a relevant argument.   1 point Explains the significance of the author’s point of view, author’s purpose, historical context, and/or audience for at least four documents.   0 points Neither utilizes the content of at least six of the documents to support the stated thesis or a relevant argument nor explains the significance of the author’s point of view, author’s purpose, historical context, and/or audience for at least four documents.  --   Is completely blank  Question 1 – Document-Based Question (continued)   C.  Using Evidence Beyond the Documents (2 points)   Targeted Skill: Contextualization (C3) and Argumentation (E3)  Contextualization  1 point Situates the argument by explaining the broader historical events, developments, or processes immediately relevant to the question.  0 points Does not situate the argument by explaining the broader historical events, developments, or processes immediately relevant to the question.   Scoring Note: Contextualization requires using knowledge not found in the documents to situate the argument within broader historical events, developments, or processes immediately relevant to the question. The contextualization point is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference, but instead requires an explanation, typically consisting of multiple sentences or a full paragraph.   Evidence Beyond the Documents  1 point Provides an example or additional piece of specific evidence beyond those found in the documents to support or qualify the argument.  0 points Does not provide an example or additional piece of specific evidence beyond those found in the documents to support or qualify the argument.  --   Is completely blank  Scoring Notes:  • This example must be different from the evidence used to earn other points on this rubric. • This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference. Responses need to reference an additional piece of specific evidence and explain how that evidence supports or qualifies the argument.   D.  Synthesis (1 point)   Targeted Skill: Synthesis (C4 or C5) 1 point Extends the argument by explaining the connections between the argument and one of the following. a) A development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area.  b) A course theme and/or approach to history that is not the focus of the essay (such as political, economic, social, cultural, or intellectual history).  0 points Does not extend the argument by explaining the connections between the argument and the other areas listed.  --   Is completely blank  Scoring Note: The synthesis point requires an explanation of the connections to a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area and is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference. Question 1 – Document-Based Question (continued)    On Accuracy: The components of this rubric each require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, the essay may contain errors that do not detract from the overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate.  On Clarity: These essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge and skills described above.       Question 1 – Document-Based Question (continued)   Scoring Notes  Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors.  A. Thesis and Argument Development (2 points)  a) Thesis Responses earn one point by presenting a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim that responds to all parts of the question (1 point). While the thesis does not need to be a single sentence, it does need to be discrete, meaning it cannot be pieced together from across multiple places within the essay. It can be located in either the introduction or the conclusion, but not split between the two.  Examples of acceptable theses: • “The women’s rights movement arose as a result of women’s experiences with inequality at work and the influence of other rights movements.” • “The women’s rights movement from 1940–1975 was caused politically by unfair treatment towards females, economically by financial discrimination towards females, and socially by the defiance of the traditional image of an American woman.” Reasons a response would not earn the thesis point include the following: • Categories too general (i.e., political, social, cultural) • Restating the question • Only including one cause Examples of unacceptable theses: • “The woman’s rights movement was the product of unfair treatment in economics, politics, and society.” • “The women’s rights movement occurred because men kept going to war leaving women behind at the home front, women were getting more and more jobs, women were frequently mistreated and undervalued during a time when rights was to be given to everyone.”  b) Argument Development To earn this point, responses must move beyond a single sentence or a listing of facts in support of the thesis or argument; they must explain the relationship of historical evidence to a complex and cohesive thesis or argument and do so throughout the essay (1 point). Evidence can be related to the argument in ways such as contradiction (e.g., using evidence to address a possible counterargument to the main argument in the essay), corroboration (e.g., combining multiple pieces of evidence to support a single argument), or qualification (e.g., use of evidence to present an argument that is subsequently made more complex by noting exceptions).  Unacceptable argument development would include: • Responses that do not develop a cohesive essay • Responses that simply parrot the documents or list the documents in order • Responses that fail to organize documents in any meaningful way • Responses that do not reconnect the evidence of the essay back to a thesis or argument  Question 1 – Document-Based Question (continued)   Examples of acceptable argument development: • “The main reason for a rise of the women’s rights movement, according to activists such as Friedan, was discontent with suburban conformity. This may have been true for white women, but a woman of color such as Mirta Vidal (Document 5) portrayed the rise of the women’s rights movement as due to a combination of the rising movement for Chicano civil rights and a growing resistance to male chauvinism within the Chicano community.” • “Although the women’s rights movement grew out of many factors, government support was a key factor in changing public beliefs about women’s roles. This occurred most powerfully during World War II, when women worked in war related manufacturing industries. The war recruiting poster (Document 1) shows how government propaganda portrayed women’s work as vital to the war effort, even in secretarial work.”  Examples of unacceptable argument development: • “In Document 2 Betty Friedan wants women to be paid the same as men for doing the same jobs. She wants women to take action and protest against wage discrimination. She believes regardless if you are a man or a woman you should get paid the same and not less because you’re a woman. In Document 7 this picture relates to women being able to have full control over their bodies. They believe they should be able to choose if they want to keep a baby or not, this also talks about a woman’s right to birth control.” o In this response, the documents are discussed without any connection to an argument. In this excerpt two documents are described, but the response does not illustrate the relationship of this evidence to support a historically complex idea.  B. Document Analysis (2 points)  a) Document Content Responses earn one point by utilizing the content of at least six of the documents to support the stated thesis or a relevant argument (1 point). Responses cannot earn a point by merely quoting or paraphrasing the documents with no connection to a thesis or argument. (See the document summaries section for descriptions of document content.)  Examples of acceptable utilization of content from a document to support a thesis or relevant argument: • Supporting the argument that women’s experiences in the workforce were crucial to the growth of the movement: “Friedan (Document 2) shows that in the 1950s, women might be treated as important by advertisers, but were not given equal pay or job opportunities in the workplace. This led Friedan to call for an end to exploitation of women on the part of major companies.” • “This lead to some, like Mirta Vidal, to feel unattached to the movement and feel as though it was an ‘Anglo thing’ (Document 5). The underlying racism and sexism within the rights movement was another cause for the movement to reshape itself for the future and for it to be more including, more like feminism is today.”    Question 1 – Document-Based Question (continued)   Examples of unacceptable utilization of content from a document to support a thesis or relevant argument:  • “In 1974, women and men protested for the rights of ‘women to choose and to refuse’ what society wants to put their sexist labels on (Document 7). If the women were given the right to choose what to wear, they would refuse to wear dresses and girdles.” • “Women were also denied the right to vote until the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1972 (Document 6).”  b) Significance of Point of View, Purpose, Context, and/or Audience   Responses earn one point by explaining the significance of the author’s point of view, author’s purpose, historical context, and/or audience for at least four documents (1 point). (See the document summaries section for description of point of view, purpose, historical context, and audience for each document.)  Examples of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s point of view: • “Freidan (Document 2), writing as a union leader, sought to show that women could fight for equal rights by being a part of a union.” • “Another cause for women to protest was their feeling that the natural rights of choice was being taken from them. Document 7 shows a demonstration protesting against laws such as the law against abortion. They felt that with the discrimination of their jobs, pay, and sex in general, their choice of abortion was another right taken away from them.” Example of unacceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s point of view: • “Document 6 also shows how the government contributed to the women’s rights movement. This document is an excerpt from the education amendments. It describes how no person can be excluded from the benefits of an education program due to race. The point of view of this document is from Congress and helps to show the political action the government took to increase women’s rights.” Examples of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s purpose: • “The wartime propaganda poster was created to recruit women into wartime industries and encourage women to participate in the war effort (Document 1). The poster asked women to see their work as valuable to U.S. society which was a feeling that would continue after the war was over.” • “An example of this call for action is described in Document 4, ‘No More Miss America.’ They call for women to stand up against idealized roles of women and how they are portrayed. They call for women to boycott against any ‘woman-garbage’ and to protest against the Pageant. They go to the extent of refusing any contact with men, even men protestors who would join them. Strong protests and visible discontent was used to push the women’s rights movement further along.”   Question 1 – Document-Based Question (continued)   Example of unacceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s purpose: • “Document 2 provides that women are ‘paid less than the underpaid sweeper’ being ‘rated lower than common labor (male).’ Betty Friedan’s purpose is to emphasize how women have the same skills as men, but are discriminated on their wage.” o This excerpt attempts to explain Friedan’s purpose but is just reiterating information found directly in the document. Examples of acceptable explanation of the significance of the historical context of a document: • “Hayden and King (Document 3), writing in 1965, used language about greater equality similar to the language used by civil rights, Great Society, and New Left movements.” • “In ‘Victory Waits on Your Fingers’ Document 1, it depicts a young woman at a type writer. It advertises for a stenograph job, and shows women that they need the support and help of women in the work force as their contribution to the war effort. It was the first time in a while that women were asked to step out of their roles as homemakers and work in paying jobs.”  Example of unacceptable explanation of the significance of the historical context of a document: • “Women such as Alice Paul demanded to be heard in the work place and act, such as Seneca Falls. They demanded rights such as Title IX and the 19th amendment.” Examples of acceptable explanation of the significance of the audience: • “The New York Radical Women prepared a press release (Document 4) in order to publicize their position and use inflammatory language to make as many women as possible join their cause.” • “Betty Freidan reveals how women are being exploited by the patriarchy to save money. She was trying to make an appeal to other women to show them how much less they are being paid and how corporate America is benefitting from this.” Example of unacceptable explanation of the significance of the audience: • “In 1972 Congress passed the Title IX amendment that established a foundation for providing equal opportunities for females in athletics and other extra-curricular activities in schools receiving federal funds. The intended audience for document 6 was everyone in the United States with school-aged children.” o The intended audience that this response discusses is too broad. The response also does not explain why this audience would be significant.  C. Using Evidence Beyond the Documents (2 points)  a) Contextualization Responses earn a point for contextualization by explaining the broader historical events, developments, or processes immediately relevant to the question (1 point). To earn the point, the essay must situate the    Question 1 – Document-Based Question (continued)   Example of unacceptable contextualization: • “The treatment of women in an inferior matter is only a part of a string of discriminations that had developed in the 1900s. During the United States’ involvement in Vietnam during a period of anti-communist sentiment, the common people were in discontent with the foreign affairs as seen with young people protesting against the war in a third world country, having no effect on their well-being, but still having to participate in the draft. This grew into a string of revolutions, one of which was the counterculture; another was the Native American Revolution for proper treatment.” o This information in this excerpt could certainly be used to add contextualization. However, the response never explains how this information is immediately relevant to the question. Another sentence or so that would connect the counterculture and/or the Civil Rights movement to the women’s rights movement would be necessary to warrant this point.  b) Evidence Beyond the Documents  Responses earn a separate point for providing an example or additional piece of specific evidence beyond those found in the documents to support or qualify the argument (1 point). Examples might include the following: • Bella Abzug • Affirmative Action policies, 1960–1970s • American Women Report, 1963 • Simone de Beauvoir, The Second Sex, 1949 • Birth control pill, 1961 • Shirley Chisholm • Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII • Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW), 1969 • Consciousness-raising • Eagle Forum • Equal Pay Act, 1963 • Betty Friedan, The Feminine Mystique, 1963 • Ruth Bader Ginsburg • Houston Conference, 1977 • Billie Jean King, tennis match against Bobbie Riggs, 1973 • Lesbian feminism/rights • Mexico City World Women’s Conference, 1975 • Ms. Magazine • Pauli Murray • National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws (NARAL), 1969 • National Organization for Women (NOW), 1966 • National Women’s Political Caucus, 1971 • No-fault divorce, 1970s • Our Bodies, Ourselves • Equal Rights Amendment • Esther Peterson   Question 1 – Document-Based Question (continued)   • President’s Commission on the Status of Women, 1961 • Reed v. Reed, 1971 • Roe v. Wade, 1973 • Eleanor Roosevelt • Rosie the Riveter • Phyllis Schlafly • Second Wave • Gloria Steinem • STOP ERA • United Nations International Year of the Woman, 1975 • WAVES, WAACS • Women’s Strike for Equality, 1971  Examples of providing an example or additional piece of specific evidence beyond those found in the documents to support or qualify the argument: • “Another influence on the rise of women's rights movement in the 1960s was the introduction of the birth control pill in 1961. The pill allowed women absolute control over birth control in a way no other contraceptive ever had. This contributed to the growing push for women to be allowed greater say in all aspects of their lives, as freedom from unexpected pregnancy meant freedom to pursue a career and plan for the future as freely as men could.” • “Many inspirational pieces of literature came out during this time to promote a women’s rights movement. However, the most significant for women’s rights was The Feminine Mystique. This book was monumental in the creation of the movement. The book was written by America’s everyday woman. She was an at-home mother doing the everyday mother things. As she interviewed some of her old friends she realized she was not the only one feeling stuck in a ‘comfortable concentration camp.’ As she published her work, women all over America realized they were not alone.”  Example of improperly providing an example or additional piece of specific evidence beyond those found in the documents to support or qualify the argument: • “Socially, women have received the short straw. In the U.S., many women are very frustrated with their current role in society. Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique highlighted this frustration and gave birth to the movement.” o While Betty Friedan’s book The Feminine Mystique could certainly be used effectively as evidence beyond the documents, here the response is not doing much more than naming the book.   Question 1 – Document-Based Question (continued)   D. Synthesis (1 point) Responses earn a point for synthesis by extending their argument in one of two possible ways (1 point).  a) Responses can extend their argument by appropriately connecting the causes of the rise of the women’s rights movement in the period 1945–1975 to other historical periods, situations, eras, or geographical areas (Synthesis proficiency C4). These connections must consist of more than just a phrase or reference. These connections might include the following: • Calls for women’s rights and writings on women’s rights in the period of the American Revolution and Atlantic World • Seneca Falls Convention, 1848; Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions • First Wave of the women’s movement in United States, 1830s to 1920, culminated in Nineteenth Amendment to Constitution, which outlawed sex discrimination in voting • Exploration of women’s rights movement in the United States after 1975, including opposition and setbacks during the 1980s; recognition of sexual harassment • Rise of the Third Wave of feminism in 1990s; recognition of the glass ceiling in the 1990s • Anita Hill accusations and hearings against Clarence Thomas, 1991 • Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, 2009 • Dismissal of women’s job discrimination claims in class action cases such as Walmart v. Dukes, 2011  Examples of acceptable synthesis by appropriately connecting the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographic area: • “The conditions that helped cause the rise of the women’s rights movement in the 20th century were similar to those that helped cause the rise of a movement for greater women’s rights in the 1840s. In both periods, calls for greater rights for African Americans led women to demand more of a voice in social and political reforms.” • “A development in a different historical period was when Alice Paul went on hunger strikes and protests in from of the White House to gain attention on passing an amendment that would give women their rights. Paul’s fight for women’s rights started with trying to get equal voting rights for women. This links to how in 1940-1975 women were fighting for equal rights in wages and other important rights.”  Example that did not accurately connect the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographic area: • A response that lists events from other time periods or areas but does not explain how they relate to the argument cannot earn a synthesis point. • “The Seneca Falls convention also served to help inspire women around the world to gain equal rights. The speech given clearly stated the way things were being conducted was unconstitutional and women should not be socially inferior to men.”   Question 1 – Document-Based Question (continued)   b)  Responses can extend their argument by appropriately connecting the causes of the rise of the women’s rights movement in the period 1945–1975 to course themes and/or approaches to history that are not the main focus of the question (Synthesis proficiency C5). These connections must consist of more than just a phrase or reference. Responses for this question could earn a point for this type of synthesis using a theme or approach that is not political or social history, for example, intellectual history. This type of synthesis was not found in the sample essays.    Question 1 – Document-Based Question (continued)   Document Summaries  The following pages present the DBQ documents along with the key aspects of each that students might offer in support of their arguments.

(Historical thinking skill: Periodization)  Maximum Possible Points: 6  Please note: • Each point of the rubric is earned independently, e.g., a student could earn the point for synthesis without earning the point for thesis. • Unique evidence from the student response is required to earn each point, e.g., evidence in the student response that qualifies for either of the targeted skill points, could not be used to earn the point for thesis.   A. Thesis (1 point) Targeted Skill: Argumentation (E1)  1 point Presents a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim and responds to all parts of the question. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion.  0 points  Does not present a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim and responds to all parts of the question.  --  Is completely blank.  B. Argument Development: Using the Targeted Historical Thinking Skill (2 points)  Targeted Skill: Argumentation (E2 and E3) and Periodization (D6)   PERIODIZATION: 1 point  Describes the ways in which the historical development specified in the prompt was different from OR similar to developments that preceded AND followed.  1 point  Explains the extent to which the historical development specified in the prompt was different from AND similar to developments that preceded AND followed.   0 points  Does not describe the ways in which the historical development specified in the prompt was different from and similar to developments that preceded AND followed.  --  Is completely blank.    Question 2 (continued)  Scoring Note: For both points, if the prompt requires evaluation of a turning point, then responses must discuss developments that preceded AND followed. For both points, if the prompt requires evaluation of the characteristics of an era, then responses can discuss developments that EITHER preceded OR followed.  C. Argument Development: Using Evidence (2 points)  Targeted Skill: Argumentation (E2 and E3)  1 point Addresses the topic of the question with specific examples of relevant evidence.  1 point Utilizes specific examples of evidence to fully and effectively substantiate the stated thesis or a relevant argument.  0 points Does not address the topic of the question with specific examples of relevant evidence.  -- Is completely blank.  Scoring Note: To fully and effectively substantiate the stated thesis or a relevant argument, responses must include a broad range of evidence that, through analysis and explanation, justifies the stated thesis or a relevant argument.  D. Synthesis (1 point)  Targeted Skill: Synthesis (C4 or C5)  a) 1 point Extends the argument by explaining the connections between the argument and ONE of the following:A development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area  b) A course theme and/or approach to history that is not the focus of the essay (such as political, economic, social, cultural, or intellectual history)  0 points Does not extend the argument by explaining the connections between the argument and the other areas listed.  --  Is completely blank.  Scoring Note: The synthesis point requires an explanation of the connections to different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area, and is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference.  On Accuracy: The components of this rubric each require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, the essay may contain errors that do not detract from the overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate.  On Clarity: These essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge and skills described above.    Question 2 (continued)  Scoring Notes  Note: Test-taker responses define the chronological beginning and end points for the essay; the focus of the response helps determine what information is considered appropriate.  Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors.  A. Thesis (1 point)   Responses earn one point by presenting a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim that responds to all parts of the question (1 point). While the thesis does not need to be a single sentence, it does need to be discrete, meaning it cannot be pieced together from across multiple places within the essay. It can be located in either the introduction or the conclusion, but not split between the two.  An acceptable thesis would evaluate the extent to which the ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments was a turning point, indicating the extent of change OR continuity. Note: Indicating explicitly the extent of change implies the extent of continuity, and vice versa.  Examples of acceptable theses:  • “The ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments marked a minimal turning point in the way African Americans were viewed, and not much in the way they were treated, as well as a minimal political shift due to African American influence in politics.” • “The 14 and 15 amendments did not mark a turning point due to the fact other legislation and Supreme court cases brought back the discrimination the amendments sought to take away.”  Unacceptable example of thesis: • “These two [amendments] caused a turning point by ensuring a better life for African Americans, for the American people as a whole and for the over-all attitude of the people of the U.S.” o The response does not address the major points of the question — how the ratification marks a major turning point for the United States politics and society. Additionally, it does not make a historically defensible claim about the impact of the amendments.  B. Argument Development: Using The Targeted Historical Thinking Skill (2 points)   a)  Argument Development — Describes   Responses earn one point by describing the ways in which relevant historical developments were different from OR similar to developments that preceded AND followed the ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments (1 point).  Example of acceptable description of a turning point: • “This included allowing blacks to vote which ultimately led to President Grant’s victory in the elections. The prosperity of the freedman increased by the Freedman’s Bureau that advocated equality in education and ownership in land. However, once the compromise of the next election occurred and ended reconstruction, the reforms of equality between races began to decline. Regardless, the Fourteen and Fifteenth amendment was still in effect; even though the poll taxes and grandfather clause restricted many blacks from voting and achieving full equality. . . .”   Question 2 (continued)  Example of unacceptable description of a turning point: • “Giving African Americans the right to vote led to the rise and creation of the Ku Klux Klan. During Ulyess [sic] S. Grant presidency. It was a majority of black votes that [got] him into office. The KKK didn’t like this new amendment, so they would use scare tactics, such as burning churches and burning African American homes, to scare black people from voting. Grant took action and forced the KKK to stop the hatred against his African American voters.” o The response strictly focuses on what follows the Fifteenth Amendment and does not address the preceding time period.  b) Argument Development — Explains   Responses can earn the point by explaining the extent to which the circumstances surrounding the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments were different from AND similar to developments that preceded and followed them (1 point).  Example of acceptable explanation of the extent of differences and similarities:  • “The Fourteenth amendment eliminated the debate that existed under the Dred Scott decision as African Americans were now citizens and had the right to sue in court. The Fourteenth amendment opened doors for African Americans as seen in . . . Board v. Board of Ed court case. If it were not for the Fourteenth amendment this court case would have never existed … Prior to the Fifteenth amendment, only white men could vote, so the Fifteenth allowed African Americans to voice their concerns to society through the power to vote. However, this amendment also marked the beginning of voting restrictions such as poll taxes and literacy tests in southern states where racist sentiment continued to exist. Politics in the south would still restrict African Americans however, these restrictions set the stage for the future in legislation such as voting rights in the 1960’s which abolished literacy tests.”  Example of unacceptable explanation of the extent of differences and similarities: • “During the Reconstruction Era, African Americans have advanced their position politically for some obtained political positions that their predecessors have never done before. This, to an extent, increased the voice in politics and decision-making process. However, most of the Southerners were still not over the idea that white people were better than black; in other words: white supremacy still permeated throughout the South, and they were not about to react kindly to these new amendments.” o This excerpt meets the standard for describing differences and similarities but is not as thorough as the previous example in explaining the extent, so it would earn only one point.  C. Argument Development: Using Evidence (2 points)   a) Using Evidence — Examples  Responses can earn one point by addressing the topic of the question by referring to specific examples or relevant evidence (1 point). Essays can earn this point without having a stated thesis or a relevant argument.    Question 2 (continued)  Examples of specific evidence that could be used to address the topic of the question:  • Three-Fifths Clause/Compromise (1787) • Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) • Abraham Lincoln • Emancipation Proclamation (1863) • Thirteenth Amendment (1865) • Civil War • Black Codes • Freedmen’s Bureau — 40 acres and a mule • Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction Plan — encouraged states to consider giving African Americans voting rights • Civil Rights Act (1866) — direct response to Black Codes and the Dred Scott decision • Ku Klux Klan/ Knights of the White Camelia/Red Shirts and White League • Reconstruction Act (1867) • Jim Crow • President Ulysses Grant • Poll taxes/Grandfather clause/Literacy tests • Ku Klux Klan Act/Enforcement Acts (1870 and 1871)Colfax, LA (1873) — mob of whites attacked a group of black Republicans • Civil Rights Act of 1875 • Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) • Radical Republicans • Redemption/Redeemers or “Bourbons” • Thaddeus Stevens • Charles Sumner • De facto/de jure segregation • New South — led to mill towns where African Americans and white people came into close contact  Examples of unsuccessfully using evidence to address the topic of the question:  • Evidence that is factually incorrect, confused about chronology, or not directly relevant to the question.  o “Abraham Lincoln helped the enslaved to be free with his creation of the emancipation proclamation which freed all slaves so Lincoln was an abolitionist which were those against Slavery. Also a known person for helping freeing slaves was Harriet Tubman she was in charge of an underground railroad that help lead the slaves escape and free on their own. Tubman escaped herself because she too was a slave so she saw her opportunity and took a chance.”  b) Using Evidence — Effective Substantiation  Responses earn a separate point by utilizing specific examples of evidence to fully and effectively substantiate a thesis or relevant argument about how the ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution marked a turning point in the history of United States politics and society    Question 2 (continued)  Fully and effectively substantiating the thesis goes beyond merely providing many examples. This point is earned by clearly and consistently linking significant evidence to the argument and showing how the evidence demonstrates how the ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution marked a turning point in the history of United States politics and society (1 point).   Examples of evidence that could be utilized to substantiate an argument:   Points arguing the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments marked a turning point could include the following: • African Americans gained suffrage and equal protection under the law for the first time. • African Americans participated in the political process during Reconstruction. o majority of eligible African Americans registered to vote; sharp increase in black voting o 2,000 black politicians elected to public office during Reconstruction o two served in U.S. Senate — Hiram Revels and Blanche K. Bruce, both from Mississippi [since then, only seven African Americans have held seats in the Senate] o Union League • New state constitutions expanded public responsibilities — especially state-funded systems of free public education. • The women’s rights movement split over the question of African American suffrage. • The Fourteenth Amendment gave African Americans legal standing in courts. • The Fourteenth Amendment overturned the Black Codes. • The Supreme Court has applied the Fourteenth Amendment to critical court cases in the 20th century (Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Roe v. Wade, and Loving v. Virginia). • The Fourteenth Amendment provides due process under law. • The Fourteenth Amendment gave Southern states more representation in the House of Representatives (previously African American slaves were counted as three-fifths of a person). • The Fourteenth Amendment also protected other racial groups such as Chinese-Americans and gave them equal protection under the law. o U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark (1898) — the Court ruled the Fourteenth Amendment awarded citizenship to children of Chinese immigrants born on American soil. • Former slaves expressed their new status  o Chose new names; changed style of dress. o Able to travel without a pass ending the “patrollers” who had enforced the “pass system.” o Conducted religious services without white supervision; consequently churches became social institutions that African Americans controlled. • Religious denominations that grew o African Methodist Episcopal o African Methodist Episcopal Zion o Ministers became key leaders within developing African American communities • Black newspapers     Question 2 (continued)  Points arguing the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments DID NOT mark a turning point could include the following: • Free African Americans in the North had previously been stripped of their rights to vote. o 1821 New York Constitution added property qualifications for blacks that were so high that almost all were stripped of the franchise o 1838 Pennsylvania Constitution stripped of the vote; black leaders protested • Reconstruction politics were almost entirely in white hands; few black politicians elected in the South after Reconstruction ended. • Myths of Old South and Lost Cause. • African Americans in the South are disenfranchised through poll taxes, literacy test, voter intimidation, and violence at polls. o laws to disenfranchise black males: poll tax (or some form of property qualification) or the “literacy” or “understanding” test (required voters to demonstrate an ability to read and interpret the Constitution) • Lynching, Ku Klux Klan, violence, and intimidation prevent blacks from exercising their legal rights until the Civil Rights movement in the 20th century  • Split in women’s rights movement arguably weakened the movement and delayed woman suffrage. o Fourteenth Amendment only penalizing a state for denying a group of men the right to vote. o Fifteenth Amendment outlawed discrimination in voting based on race, but not gender. o First time the word “male” was introduced into the Constitution in connection with voting rights. o 1873 NAWSA members tried to register to vote — to test the new amendments.  Minor v. Happersett (1875) — suffrage rights were not inherent in citizenship; women were citizens, but state legislatures could deny women the vote if they wished • Few black politicians elected in the South after Reconstruction ended. • Federal government ignored gross violations of the equal protection clause until the Civil Rights movement. o Slaughterhouse Cases (1873)  o United States v. Cruikshank (1876) and United States v. Reese (1876) o Hall v. DeCuir (1878)  o Civil Rights Cases (1883)  • Supreme Court upheld Jim Crow laws legalizing segregation in the South in Plessy v. Ferguson. o Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)  o Cumming v. County Board of Education (1899) • Sharecropping/crop lien system/tenant farming. o No land distribution • NAACP (est. 1910) struggled for enforcement of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.  o Guinn v. U.S. (1915) o Buchanan v. Warley (1917)   Question 2 (continued)   Example of utilizing evidence to substantiate an argument:  • “Racist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, led by Nathan Forrest used violence to threaten and intimidate African Americans from exercising their new rights.” Examples of unsuccessfully attempting to substantiate an argument with evidence:  • “Plessy v. Ferguson outlined the state of blacks and whites together as “separate but equal.” o While the information is correct, it does not address the Court’s upholding the constitutionality of segregation.  • “Laws also required literacy tests in order to vote. Most African Americans were not educated and were therefore unable to vote.” o Very simplistic and does not develop the impact of literacy tests fully.  D. Synthesis (1 point)  Essays earn a point for synthesis by extending their argument in one of two possible ways (1 point).  a) Responses can extend their argument by explaining the connections between their argument and a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area (Synthesis proficiency C4). These connections must consist of more than just a phrase or reference.   Possible connections could include the following: • Explicitly linking the discussion to the long-term impacts of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments in the 20th century, such as the judicial revolution under the Warren Court • Explicitly linking the amendments to major civil rights laws such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965  Examples of synthesis by connecting the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area: • “The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments were a sign of a new era in American society and politics, but were not enough to get the country to its destination. Nearly one hundred years after the Civil War, the 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Ed of Topeka ended the legality of Jim Crow segregation, and ten years later the Civil Rights Act of 1964 made equality mostly present. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 further solidified the promises from those two amendments. Thus, the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments were crucial as a step in the right direction, but largely failed in immediately changing the political and social culture of the United States.” • “Much like the ratification of the 14th and 15th amendments was the ratification of the 19th amendment in 1920. This amendment gave suffrage to women and created significant social and political changes in the decade that followed. As women were given the right to vote, they gained political influence, much like the African Americans who gained the right to vote. Furthermore, they helped to usher in a new social era that gravitated towards wealth and success and a more liberal sentiment in America. The passage of the 14th and 15th amendments as well as the 19th amendment had significant impacts on the political and social climate of the United States, but also reflected some continuity as both groups continued to face discrimination in some ways.”   Question 2 (continued)  Example that did not accurately connect the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area: • “The intimidation methods of freed African Americas is much like the Palmer Raids during the Red Scare because entities like HUAC intimidated workers who wanted to form unions, as did entities like the Ku Klux Klan to African Americans who wanted to exercise their rights.” o This is a confused attempt to link the methods used by the KKK to intimidate African Americans to the Palmer Raids and the HUAC. It does not clearly extend the argument to make a connection to a different historical time period.   b) Responses can extend their argument by explaining the connections between their argument and a course theme and/or approach to history that is not the focus of the essay, such as political, economic, social, cultural, or intellectual history (Synthesis proficiency C5). These connections must consist of more than just a phrase or reference. Possible connections could include explicitly calling out the international aspects of a largely domestic story.  Example of synthesis by connecting the argument to a different course theme or approach to history: • “The treatment of African Americans after the passing of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment is similar to that of the Native Americans who were constantly promised that if they were to relocate to another area then there could be no interruption from settlers again. This constantly broken promise is similar to the constantly broken promise to freed blacks that they are citizens and have unalienable rights when in fact they are not given.”  Example that did not accurately connect the argument to a different course theme or approach to history: • “Identity connects by making most Americans seem equal in “identity” and have their own name for themselves. These groups were brought closer to what it means to be an American and their opportunities skyrocketed from there on.” o This does not extend the argument by explaining the connection between the argument and another course theme.   Question 3  Evaluate the extent to which United States participation in the First World War (1917–1918) marked a turning point in the nation’s role in world affairs.  In the development of your argument, explain what changed and what stayed the same from the period immediately before the war to the period immediately following it. (Historical thinking skill: Periodization).  Maximum Possible Points: 6  Please note: • Each point of the rubric is earned independently, e.g., a student could earn the point for synthesis without earning the point for thesis. • Unique evidence from the student response is required to earn each point, e.g., evidence in the student response that qualifies for either of the targeted skill points could not be used to earn the point for thesis.   A. Thesis (1 point) Targeted Skill: Argumentation (E1)  1 point Presents a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim and responds to all parts of the question.

For both points, if the prompt requires evaluation of the characteristics of an era, then responses can discuss developments that EITHER preceded OR followed.  Question 3 (continued)  C. Argument Development: Using Evidence (2 points)  Targeted Skill: Argumentation (E2 and E3)  1 point Addresses the topic of the question with specific examples of relevant evidence.  1 point Utilizes specific examples of evidence to fully and effectively substantiate the stated thesis or a relevant argument.  0 points Does not address the topic of the question with specific examples of relevant evidence.  -- Is completely blank.  Scoring Note: To fully and effectively substantiate the stated thesis or a relevant argument, responses must include a broad range of evidence that, through analysis and explanation, justifies the stated thesis or a relevant argument.  D. Synthesis (1 point)  Targeted Skill: Synthesis (C4 or C5)  1 point Extends the argument by explaining the connections between the argument and ONE of the following: a) A development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area.  b) A course theme and/or approach to history that is not the focus of the essay (such as political, economic, social, cultural, or intellectual history).   0 points Does not extend the argument by explaining the connections between the argument and the other areas listed.  --  Is completely blank  Scoring Note: The synthesis point requires an explanation of the connections to different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area, and is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference.  On Accuracy: The components of this rubric each require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, the essay may contain errors that do not detract from the overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate.  On Clarity: These essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge and skills described above.      Question 3 (continued)  Scoring Notes  Note: Test-taker responses define the chronological beginning and end points for the essay; the focus of the response helps determine what information is considered appropriate.  Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors.  A. Thesis (1 point)   Responses earn one point by presenting a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim that responds to all parts of the question (1 point). While the thesis does not need to be a single sentence, it does need to be discrete, meaning it cannot be pieced together from across multiple places within the essay. It can be located in either the introduction or the conclusion, but not split between the two.  An acceptable thesis would evaluate the extent to which United States participation in the First World War was a turning point, indicating the extent of change OR continuity. Note: Indicating explicitly the extent of change implies the extent of continuity, and vice versa.  Examples of acceptable theses:  • “The First World War has been widely considered as the nation’s turning point in world affairs. However, it was the Second, not the First World War that really impacted our nation’s foreign policy. Although the First World War created a lasting mark internationally, our nation sought to return to a period of isolationism after the war.” • “Before World War One the United States attempted to stay as nuetral [sic] and isolated from Europe as possible so as to avoid unnecessary conflict. This had been its foreign policy as much as possible since the days of Washington and the First World War changed that when the United States got involved. The war marked a turning point in America’s national role to a great extent as it paved the way for more involvement outside of our own country.”   Unacceptable example of thesis: The following statement does not address the extent of the First World War as a turning point. • “The United States has always been a powerhouse country. The American economy has been strong (despite a couple of bumps) and the people even stronger. The First World War showed the true power of the United States due to the willingness of its citizens and the brightness of their minds.”  B. Argument Development: Using The Targeted Historical Thinking Skill (2 points)  a)  Argument Development — Describes   Responses earn one point by describing the ways in which relevant historical developments were different from OR similar to developments that preceded AND followed United States participation in the First World War (1 point).   Question 3 (continued)  Example of acceptable description of a turning point:  • “Prior to the war, America was not interested in joining the effort. . . . After successful outcomes within the war with other European countries, the United States became a key player in world affairs. . . . A turning point was made when the United States joined World War I because the country was able to gain confidence in their military and political influence. . . . Although the United States never joined the League, the nation still aided its victory and played an influential role at the Paris Peace Conference when signing the Treaty of Versailles.” Example of unacceptable descriptions of a turning point:  • “After WWI . . . isolationist sentiment reigned. In fact, most people just wanted to return to the period before the war, thus Republican Warren G. Harding won on the slogan, “a return to normalcy” & focused on internal affairs during his presidency. . . . Once the Depression began, the dire condition of the United States economy was the focus of the American people and presidents. . . . Overall, the isolationist sentiment of the post WWI America reflected a continuity in United States foreign policy that would never be truly broken until WWII.”  o There is no discussion of events prior to the war, therefore no point is awarded for Periodization. b) Argument Development — Explains   Responses earn one point by explaining the extent to which relevant historical developments were different from AND similar to developments that preceded AND followed United States participation in the First World War (1 point).  Example of acceptable explanation of the extent of differences and similarities:   • “The United States’ shift from isolationism to interventionalism [sic] was a drastic change in American foreign policy as the nation switched its views on treatment of the world almost entirely after its participation in World War I. Before the Great War, Americans were wary of the issues that could come about from engaging in foreign affairs and were more than reluctant to join a war half-way across the world. . . . America’s desire to protect democracy was full of passion and is ultimately what caused the drastic change in foreign policy. While the nation did change its mind on involvement with the rest of the world, one fear remained constant. . . . an unwavering fear of radicals.” Example of unacceptable explanation of the extent of differences and similarities:  • “Without the United States the League of Nations fell apart and the United States remained in the same role in world affairs as it was in before World War I. . . . After the defeat of the Central Powers, the United States was primed to lead the world towards peace and recovery. But the U.S. backed down and returned to isolationism and continued its limited role in World Affairs.  . . . Before its entry into WWI the United States foreign policy was isolationism, the same policy    Question 3 (continued)  • of the first president, George Washington. Like Washington, Woodrow Wilson felt that isolationism was the best chance for prosperity in the United States.”   o This essay remains general in describing ways in which historical development was different from and similar to developments that preceded or followed the First World War. References to the League of Nations, Wilson’s Fourteen Points, and George Washington’s Farewell Address gain credit under “Using Evidence.”  C. Argument Development: Using Evidence (2 points)   a) Using Evidence — Examples  Responses can earn one point by addressing the topic of the question by referring to specific examples or relevant evidence (1 point). Essays can earn this point without having a stated thesis or a relevant argument.   Examples of successfully using evidence to address the topic of the question:  • “In addition, Wilson’s large role in negotiating the Treaty of Versailles and the formation of the League of Nations precipitated the U.S.’s future role as an international negotiator.” • “Before the war started, Woodrow Wilson had the task of slowly easing America into the idea of fighting in Europe; in doing so, Wilson became more involved in the world, already established by Teddy Roosevelt and his flaunting of the navy.” Examples of specific evidence that could be used to address the topic of the question: • William Jennings Bryan • Eugene Debs • Fourteen Points • Hawley-Smoot Tariff • Herbert Hoover • Irreconcilables • League of Nations • Henry Cabot Lodge • Lusitania • Treaty of Versailles • Washington Naval Conference • President Woodrow Wilson  Examples of unsuccessfully using evidence to address the topic of the question:  • “The First World War also presented ourselves as anti-communism and showed other countries the U.S.’s values and morals.”  o The evidence is factually incorrect, confused about chronology, or not directly relevant to the question. • “Things such as creating allies and having people agree to be on our side gave the US a lot of confidence which would also help us win the war.” o The examples are not adequately specific or relevant.    Question 3 (continued)  b) Using Evidence — Effective Substantiation  Responses earn a separate point by utilizing specific examples of evidence to fully and effectively substantiate a thesis or relevant argument about how United States participation in the First World War marked a turning point in the nation’s role in world affairs (1 point). Fully and effectively substantiating the thesis goes beyond merely providing many examples. This point is earned by clearly and consistently linking significant evidence to the argument and showing how the evidence demonstrates how the United States participation in the First World War marked a turning point in the nation’s role in world affairs.   Examples of evidence that could be utilized to substantiate an argument:   Points that address the extent of U.S. involvement in world affairs could include the following:  • The First World War marked the end of United States isolationism. It was the first time the United States was involved in a European war. • Woodrow Wilson led the negotiations of the Treaty of Versailles. He attempted to influence European politics with his Fourteen Points and League of Nations. • The First World War can be seen as a break in the United States emergence as an imperial power (represented by the annexation of Hawaii; the Spanish-American War; and the annexation of the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico) because Wilson sought to end imperialism and “to make the world safe for democracy.” • Submarine warfare made it impossible for the American public to ignore the European conflict (evidenced by sinking of the Lusitania) and to remain neutral. • The war had a strong impact on American society. The federal government and industry cooperated for wartime production. The United States implemented its first income tax to fund the war effort. • The United States greatly expanded its military during the war and had its first large military draft since the Civil War.  • The United States government sought to curtail the free speech of many opponents of the war.   Points arguing that the First World War was not as significant a turning point in the role of the United States in world affairs could include the following:  • The United States retreated to isolationism in the 1920s, as evidenced by the refusal by the Senate to ratify the Treaty of Versailles. • The United States erected high tariffs during the interwar period as part of the retreat to isolationism (Hawley-Smoot Tariff). • Henry Cabot Lodge successfully prevented the United States from joining the League of Nations. • The First World War can be seen as a continuation of the United States emergence as an imperial power (as evidenced by the annexation of Hawaii; the Spanish-American War; and the annexation of the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico). • Wilson was unable to include most of his Fourteen Points (other than the League of Nations) in the final treaty. • United States participation in the war could be regarded as a continuation of Wilson’s attempts to expand United States influence in Mexico and to overthrow Porfirio Diaz. • The United States reduced the size of its military after the war and decided not to maintain a large standing army (evidenced by the Washington Naval Conference).  Question 3 (continued)  Examples of utilizing evidence to fully and effectively substantiate an argument:  • “Though America was never completely isolationist, WW1 led to a radical change in U.S. foreign relations. WW1 cemented America’s role as a protector of democracy, as specifically claimed by Wilson in his declaration of war.” • “Prior to World War 1, America had been the protectors of the Western Hemisphere, never leaving it, as governed by the Monroe Doctrine and the Roosevelt Corollary. After it, America extended its hemisphere of influence to the entire world.” Examples of unsuccessfully attempting to substantiate an argument with evidence:  • “Because the war was originally between Germany and England, the U.S. was sort of a third party participant. The concept of intervention proved that the U.S. was still indecisive whether or not to fully involve themselves.” o The response does not link the evidence fully to substantiate the argument. • “Some things that changed were the increased economic and political power after the war. We grew as an economy because people were working, fighting, spending, and buying.” o The response is no more than a simple description.  D. Synthesis (1 point)  Essays earn a point for synthesis by extending their argument in one of two possible ways (1 point).  a) Responses can extend their argument by explaining the connections between their argument and a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area (Synthesis proficiency C4). These connections must consist of more than just a phrase or reference.   Possible connections could include the following: • Explicitly comparing the impact of the First World War with that of another earlier or later conflict (i.e., the Civil War, the Second World War, the Vietnam War).  Examples of synthesis by connecting the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area: • Synthesis with inclusion in thesis: o Thesis — “The US’s involvement in WWI marked a turning point in its role internationally, as foreign policy shifted from that of isolation to a more imperialistic policy of intervention.”  o Student’s Synthesis: “Eventually, policy shifted even further to that of pure intervention. American troops were sent to fight communists in both Korea and Vietnam. Instead of offering economic aid, explicit military force was being used to contain communism. This interventionist policy is still maintained today, where recently the US has intervened in Middle Eastern countries like Iraq and Afghanistan under the guise of trying to establish stability with the real intention of keeping its supply of raw oil secure.”  • Synthesis without inclusion in thesis:  o “Ever since WWI, to even present day, the USA has been perceived differently, not just a global power but a global power with responsibility to wield it in enforcing global peace and human rights. When WWII ended and former high-ranking Nazis were put on trial for crimes against humanity, it was an American lawyer who prosecuted them. When communism threatened to engulf Korea, the US stepped [sic]. Ill-advised or not, when Vietnam and Afghanistan needed aid, the US sent forces. When Syria continued to burn,  Question 3 (continued)  public outcry against the decision not to aid came from both sides of the political aisle. In the 1980s, we accepted Cuban refugees with open arms. Today we do the same with displaced Syrians. Who knows what tomorrow will bring?”  Example that did not accurately connect the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area: • “Americans established themselves as a general super power. The US became so engrossed in foreign affairs that we would eventually join NATO and the UN permanently alliancing [sic] and linking ourselves with the affairs and global views. Thus, involvement in WWI marked the shift of American history from a period of isolationist to a time of active foreign affair involvement.”  o While this statement takes the discussion beyond the historical period targeted by the question, the student response fails to explain the connection between their argument and the development of a later or earlier historical period, situation, era or geographical area. Instead, it just asserts that the United States joined NATO and the UN and involved ourselves in “the affairs and global views.”  b) Responses can extend their argument by explaining the connections between their argument and a course theme and/or approach to history that is not the focus of the essay, such as political, economic, social, cultural, or intellectual history (Synthesis proficiency C5). These connections must consist of more than just a phrase or reference. Possible connections could include the following explicitly calling out the domestic aspects of a largely international story.  Examples of synthesis by connecting the argument to a different course theme or approach to history: • Synthesis with focus/thesis of the essay – o “Just as slavery persisted from the 18th Century and met its grizzly [sic] end in the 19th Century, the events of the early 1900s, dominated by violent conflict in Europe, would destroy American belief in non-interventionalism [sic] permanently and propel the US onto the stage as a foremost political, social, and military authority.  o Student’s synthesis: “Beyond diplomacy, being an industrial powerhouse with no damage to said industry due to the ravages of war allowed American business to become pivotal to the markets of allies in Europe and Asia, and eventually all across the world. The economy of the following decade, the Roaring 20s, was based heavily on the vast fortunes that one could amass in the stock market – an institution propped up and integrated into business interests all over, but especially in Europe. The extent of the US’s influence over the economies worldwide post-WWI was no more apparent than when this stock-based economy collapsed, and the whole world fell with it. As the 20s ended and the miserable decade of the 1930s began, economic depression had crippled all aspects of life for millions of Americans – but also for people worldwide. The failure of American banks and American business left the whole world hurting. Countries in already dire situations, such as the defeated and humiliated Germany, were hurtled into an economic downturn and societal suffering unmatched by even the Americans whose recklessness set off the chain reaction in the first place.”   Question 3 (continued)  Example that did not accurately connect the argument to a different course theme or approach to history: • Synthesis with focus/thesis of the essay:  o “The First World War was an event that irrevocably shaped America. It marked a change that altered the US culturally, politically, and economically. The interventionalist [sic] policy, industrial boom, and feminism that emerged from the first World War would shape America’s future.” o Student’s synthesis: “After military success, and an amazing economic boom due to increased industrial production, the US saw itself jump to the forefront of international affairs as a leading industrial powerhouse and military power. Furthermore, the role of women in America changed, as with the men away they were introduced to the work force. Women not only remained the primary care takers in the family, they also worked in factories and were the bread-winners in many families. This change in the role of women significantly shaped American gender roles for years to come and inspired a growth of feminism that carried into the women’s rights movement of the 1940s.” o While the student does target industrial and cultural (gender) influences and explain them in connection to the argument of the paper, they included these same aspects within their thesis statement—making them a part of the focus of the response and negating the usage of these same topics for synthesis points according to the rubric. Question 1 – Document-Based Question (continued)   thesis, argument, or parts of the argument by accurately and explicitly connecting the causes of the rise of the women’s rights movement in the period 1945–1975 to larger historical processes. Examples might include: • The experience of women after the Nineteenth Amendment or in finding employment during the Great Depression • Federal encouragement of women to fill defense jobs during the Second World War • Women granted permanent status in the Armed Forces, 1948 • Longstanding cultural prescriptions of women as homemakers, responsible for the domestic sphere; social and cultural pressure for women to return to being homemakers and relinquish jobs for returning wartime veterans during the 1950s • Rise of suburban communities, isolated women in suburban homes with nuclear family, 1950s • The rise of the Civil Rights movement • Democratic administrations’ support for women’s rights • Liberal feminism or women’s rights advocates conflicts with more radical women’s liberationists; use of the law and policy to change women’s status; use of protests and demonstrations to change women’s status; separatist politics • Emergence of radical feminism and women’s liberation sometimes in support of, but sometimes in opposition to, liberal feminism; tensions within the women’s rights movement over issues of race, sexual orientation, class, ethnicity • Protest movements in the 1960s such as the student movement, the Free Speech movement, anti-war protestors, the counterculture, establishment of communal societies, Red Power movement • The development of a new conservative movement from the 1960s to the 1980s, which opposed many of the positions held by supporters of women’s rights • The emergence of an antifeminist movement and conservative women’s opposition to women’s rights and feminism • Movement of women into the workforce in larger numbers after the 1960s • Longstanding discrimination against women in the workforce and/or unequal treatment on the job • Dual income families in the 1970s • Recognition of violence against women, domestic abuse; establishment of women’s shelters • Recognition of women’s inequality in healthcare and services • Depiction of women in advertising reinforced gender stereotypes; advertising and cultural stereotypes as source of oppression • Outlawing of male-wanted and female-wanted job advertisements, 1968 • United States experienced period of economic boom in the 1950s to 1960s, and period of economic decline or contraction in the 1970s  Example of acceptable contextualization: • “In the beginning of the period of 1940-1975 World War II caused American men to be away while minorities such as women took the place of men and joined the workforce. The 1950s saw a return to those traditional family values of women staying in the house while their husbands are away working to make money. However, by the 1960s the controversy over the Vietnam War started the hippie movement in which they said ‘make peace not war.’ This caused many women to begin to question their traditional roles in society. There was also a young counterculture movement which saw young people expressing themselves though rock n’ roll, drugs, and such. All of this encouraged women to begin their fights for a new, politically empowered role in society.”
