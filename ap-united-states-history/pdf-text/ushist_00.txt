[T]he strike is apparently hopeless, and must be regarded as nothing more than a rash and spiteful demonstration of resentment by men too ignorant or too reckless to understand their own interests. . . . But if the strike on the Baltimore and Ohio Road is a foolish one, its history up to the present time shows that those who are engaged in it are not only bold and determined, but that they have the sympathy of a large part of the community in which they live. . . . Document C Source: Thomas Nast cartoon in Harper’s Weekly, 1878 Photo Courtesy of the Newberry Library. Document D Source: The testimony of a machinist before the Senate Committee on Labor and Capital, 1883 Question: Is there any difference between the conditions under which machinery is made now and those which existed ten years ago? Answer: A great deal of difference. Question: State the differences as well as you can. Answer: Well, the trade has been subdivided and those subdivisions have been again subdivided, so that a man never learns the machinist’s trade now. Ten years ago he learned, not the whole of the trade, but a fair portion of it. In the case of making the sewing-machine, for instance, you find that the trade is so subdivided that a man is not considered a machinist at all. In that way machinery is produced a great deal cheaper than it used to be formerly, and in fact, through this system of work, 100 men are able to do now what it took 300 or 400 men to do fifteen years ago. Document E Source: Western Union Telegraph Company employee contract, 1883 I, [name] of [city] in consideration of my present reemployment by the Western Union Telegraph Co. hereby promise and agree to and with the said company that I will forthwith abandon any and all membership, connection or affiliation with any organization or society, whether secret or open, which in anywise attempts to regulate the conditions of my services or the payment thereof while in the employment now undertaken.

It is charged, therefore, with the duty of keeping those highways of interstate commerce free from obstruction, for it has always been recognized as one of the powers and duties of a government to remove obstructions from the highway under its control . . . Document I Source: Testimony of Samuel Gompers before a commission established by the House of Representatives on the Relations and Conditions of Capital and Labor, 1899 The working people find that improvements in the methods of production and distribution are constantly being made, and unless they occasionally strike, or have the power to enter upon a strike, the improvements will all go to the employer and all the injuries to the employees. . . . The American Republic was not established without some suffering, without some sacrifice, and no tangible right has yet been achieved in the interest of the people unless it has been secured by sacrifices and persistency. END OF DOCUMENTS FOR QUESTION 1 UNITED STATES HISTORY SECTION II Part B and Part C (Suggested total planning and writing time—70 minutes) Percent of Section II score—55 Part B Directions: Choose ONE question from this part.
