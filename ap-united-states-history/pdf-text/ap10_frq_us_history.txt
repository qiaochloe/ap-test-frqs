And unless they be better taught of God, they will use it ever and anon. . . . No man would think what desperate deceit and wickedness there is in the hearts of men. It is therefore most wholesome for magistrates and officers in church and commonwealth never to affect more liberty and authority than will do them good, and the people good: for whatever transcendent power is given will certainly overrun those that give it and  those that receive it. . . . It is therefore fit for every man to be studious of the bounds which the Lord hath set:  and for the people, in whom fundamentally all power lies, to give as much power as God in His word gives to men. . . . So let there be due bounds set—and I may apply it to families: it is good for the wife to acknowledge all power and authority to the husband . . . And so for children and servants, or any other you are to deal with:  give them liberty and authority you would have them use, and beyond that stretch not the tether; it will not tend to their good nor yours. © 2010 The College Board.

Let merchants and such as are increasing Cent per Cent remember this. . . . that worldly gain was not the end and designe of the people of New England, but Religion. END OF DOCUMENTS FOR QUESTION 1 © 2010 The College Board.
