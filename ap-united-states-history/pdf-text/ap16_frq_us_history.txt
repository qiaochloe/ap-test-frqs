The test preparation materials  in this document include images for which descriptions are provided. In a standard test, the images are presented without descriptions. In this document, descriptions are included with the images so that assistive technology users will have an understanding of what is in each image. However, some of the image descriptions may not be valid for testing purposes; and in certain cases we cannot make all of the content accessible due to the construct or design of particular test questions.  Therefore, on an actual test in an alternate format, some questions may be omitted if they include images that cannot be described without affecting the question’s validity. If any questions are omitted, the scoring rules for the test take such omissions into account to make sure that you are neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by the omissions and that your scores are comparable to those of individuals taking another version of the test.A P logoAP® United States History 2016 Free-Response Questions © 2016 The College Board.

These men were robber barons as were their medieval counterparts, the dominating figures of an aggressive economic age.... Under their hands, the renovation of our economic life proceeded relentlessly; large-scale production replaced the scattered, decentralized mode of production; industrial enterprises became more concentrated, more ‘efficient’ technically, and essentially ‘cooperative,’ where they had been purely individualistic and lamentably wasteful.” Matthew Josephson, historian, 1934 “What really lifted the giants above the rest was the ability to envision where the world, or their part of it, was going, and to act on that vision in a creative way.... From the days of Adam Smith, self-interest has been the acknowledged driving force of capitalism; the secret of the market system is that one person’s self-interest can simultaneously serve the interests of others. Buyers and sellers, producers and consumers, investors and entrepreneurs take reciprocal advantage of each other. Success rewards those who can discover or create areas of reciprocity; the larger the area, the greater the success.... They were captains of industry; but like officers of volunteer regiments, they held their posts at the sufferance of those they led.” H. W.

The image is a poster, that displays a smiling young White woman sitting behind a typewriter and performing a military-style salute with her right hand. The poster states, Victory waits on your fingers—Keep ’em flying, Miss U.S.A. Uncle Sam needs stenographers! Get Civil Service information at your local post office.

In advertisements across the land, industry glorifies the American woman—in her gleaming GE kitchen, at her Westinghouse laundromat, before her Sylvania television set. Nothing is too good for her—unless she works for GE, or Westinghouse, or Sylvania or thousands of other corporations throughout the U.S.A. As an employee, regardless of her skill, she is rated lower than common labor (male). She is assigned to jobs which, according to government studies, involve greater physical strain and skill than many jobs done by men—but she is paid less than the underpaid sweeper, the least skilled men in the plant. She is speeded up until she may faint at her machine, to barely earn her daily bread. Wage discrimination against women workers exists in every industry where women are employed. It exists because it pays off in billions of dollars in extra profits for the companies. According to the 1950 census, the average wage of women in factories was $1,285 a year less than men....In just one year, U.S. corporations made five billion four hundred million dollars in extra profits from their exploitation of women. Document 3 Source: “Sex and Caste: A Kind of Memo from Casey Hayden and Mary King to a number of other women in the peace and freedom movements,” 1965. Women we’ve talked to who work in the [peace and civil rights] movement seem to be caught up in a common-law caste system that operates, sometimes subtly, forcing them to work around or outside hierarchical structures of power which may exclude them. Women seem to be placed in the same position of assumed subordination in personal situations too. It is a caste system which, at its worst, uses and exploits women. The caste system perspective dictates the roles assigned to women in the [peace and civil rights] movement, and certainly even more to women outside the movement. Within the movement, questions arise in situations ranging from relationships of women organizers to men in the community, to who cleans the freedom house, to who holds leadership positions, to who does secretarial work, and who acts as spokesman [spokesperson] for groups. Other problems arise between women with varying degrees of awareness of themselves as being as capable as men but held back from full participation, or between women who see themselves as needing more control of their work than other women demand. Casey Hayden and Mary Elizabeth King. Excerpt edited by the publisher. Document 4 Source: Robin Morgan and the New York Radical Women, press release, “No More Miss America!,” 1968. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE On September 7th in Atlantic City, the Annual Miss America Pageant will again crown “your ideal.” But this year, reality will liberate the contest auction-block in the guise of “genyooine” de-plasticized, breathing women.... Women of every political persuasion—all are invited to join us in a day-long boardwalk-theater event.... We will protest the image of Miss America, an image that oppresses women in every area in which it purports to represent us. There will be: Picket Lines; Guerrilla Theater; Leafleting; Lobbying Visits to the contestants urging our sisters to reject the Pageant Farce and join us; a huge Freedom Trash Can (into which we will throw bras, girdles, curlers, false eyelashes, wigs, and representative issues of Cosmopolitan, Ladies’ Home Journal, Family Circle, etc.—bring any such woman-garbage you have around the house); we will also announce a Boycott of all those commercial products related to the Pageant....It should be a groovy day on the Boardwalk in the sun with our sisters. In case of arrests, however, we plan to reject all male authority and demand to be busted by policewomen only. Male chauvinist-reactionaries on this issue had best stay away, nor are male liberals welcome in the demonstrations. But sympathetic men can donate money as well as cars and drivers. Male reporters will be refused interviews. We reject patronizing reportage. Only newswomen will be recognized. “No More Miss America!” from SISTERHOOD IS POWERFUL An Anthology of Writings from the Women’s Liberation Movement © 1970 by Robin Morgan.

[The] awakening of Chicana consciousness has been prompted by the “machismo” she encounters in the movement.... This behavior...isa serious obstacle to women anxious to play a role in the struggle for Chicano liberation. The oppression suffered by Chicanas is different from that suffered by most women in this country. Because Chicanas are part of an oppressed nationality, they are subjected to the racism practiced against La Raza. Since the overwhelming majority of Chicanos are workers, Chicanas are also victims of the exploitation of the working class. But in addition, Chicanas...are relegated to an inferior position because of their sex. Thus, Raza women suffer a triple form of oppression.... Because sexism and male chauvinism are so deeply rooted in this society, there is a strong tendency...todenythe basic right of Chicanas to organize around their own concrete issues. Instead they are told to stay away from the women’s liberation movement because it is an “Anglo thing.” Copyright © 1971 by Pathfinder Press.

No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. Document 7 Source: Image of a crowd at a reproductive rights demonstration, Pittsburgh, PA, 1974. The image is a photograph of a crowd of people standing on a street and holding homemade signs. Two women are holding a large sign that says, “The Right To Choose” in bold capital letters. A smaller sign on a lamppost states, “The right to choose is the right to refuse.” Each sign has 2 gender symbols for woman painted on them. The group of people includes both women and men and seems to include people of varied ethnicities.Barbara Freeman/Getty Images END OF DOCUMENTS FOR QUESTION 1
