The cities predicted the future.... Urban people, at a certain point in the preindustrial era, upset the equilibrium of an older system of social relations and turned the seaport towns into crucibles of revolutionary agitation.” Gary B. Nash, historian, The Urban Crucible, 1986 “The colonist’s attitudes toward civil uprising were part of a broader Anglo-American political tradition. In the course of the eighteenth century, colonists became increasingly interested in the ideas of seventeenth-century English revolutionaries...andthe later writers who carried on and developed this tradition....Bythe 1760s...this... tradition provided a strong unifying element between colonists North and South. It offered, too, a corpus of ideas about public authority and popular political responsibilities that shaped the American revolutionary movement. Spokesmen for this English revolutionary tradition were distinguished in the eighteenth century above all by their outspoken defense of the people’s right to rise up against their rulers.” Pauline Maier, historian, From Resistance to Revolution, 1991 1.

Evaluate the relative importance of different causes for the expanding role of the United States in the world in the period from 1865 to 1910. Document 1 Source: Treaty concerning the Cession of the Russian Possessions in North America by his Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias to the United States of America, June 20, 1867. His Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias agrees to cede to the United States, by this convention, immediately upon the exchange of the ratifications thereof, all the territory and dominion now possessed by his said Majesty on the continent of America and in the adjacent islands, the same being contained within the geographical limits herein set forth.... The inhabitants of the ceded territory, according to their choice...may return to Russia within three years; but if they should prefer to remain in the ceded territory, they, with the exception of uncivilized native tribes, shall be admitted to the enjoyment of all the rights, advantages, and immunities of citizens of the United States, and shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property, and religion. The uncivilized tribes will be subject to such laws and regulations as the United States may, from time to time, adopt in regard to aboriginal tribes of that country.... In consideration of the cession aforesaid, the United States agree to pay...seven million two hundred thousand dollars in gold. Document 2 Source: Josiah Strong, Our Country: Its Possible Future and Its Present Crisis, 1885. It seems to me that God, with infinite wisdom and skill, is training the Anglo-Saxon race for an hour sure to come in the world’s future. Heretofore there has always been in the history of the world a comparatively unoccupied land westward, into which the crowded countries of the East have poured their surplus populations. But the widening waves of migration, which millenniums ago rolled east and west from the valley of the Euphrates, meet today on our Pacific coast. There are no more new worlds. The unoccupied arable lands of the earth are limited, and will soon be taken. The time is coming when the pressure of population on the means of subsistence will be felt here as it is now felt in Europe and Asia. Then will the world enter upon a new stage of its history—the ﬁnal competition of races, for which the Anglo-Saxon is being schooled.... Then this race of unequaled energy, with all the majesty of numbers and the might of wealth behind it—the representative, let us hope, of the largest liberty, the purest Christianity, the highest civilization—having developed peculiarly aggressive traits calculated to impress its institutions upon mankind, will spread itself over the earth. Document 3 Source: Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, The Interest of America in Sea Power, Present and Future, 1897. To affirm the importance of distant markets, and the relation to them of our own immense powers of production, implies logically the recognition of the link that joins the products and the markets,—that is, the carrying trade; the three together constituting that chain of maritime power to which Great Britain owes her wealth and greatness. Further, is it too much to say that, as two of these links, the shipping and the markets, are exterior to our own borders, the acknowledgment of them carries with it a view of the relations of the United States to the world radically distinct from the simple idea of self-sufficingness?... There will dawn the realization of America’s unique position, facing the older worlds of the East and West, her shores washed by the oceans which touch the one or the other, but which are common to her alone. Despite a certain great original superiority conferred by our geographical nearness and immense resources,—due, in other words, to our natural advantages, and not to our intelligent preparations,—the United States is woefully unready, not only in fact but in purpose, to assert in the Caribbean and Central America a weight of influence proportioned to the extent of her interests. We have not the navy, and, what is worse, we are not willing to have the navy, that will weigh seriously in any disputes with those nations whose interests will conflict there with our own. We have not, and we are not anxious to provide, the defence of the seaboard which will leave the navy free for its work at sea. We have not, but many other powers have, positions, either within or on the borders of the Caribbean. Document 4 Source: The Boston Globe, May 28, 1898. The figure presents a political cartoon with the caption, “Well, I hardly know which to take first!” The cartoon shows Uncle Sam sitting at a table in a restaurant. President William McKinley stands at the table, dressed as a server. Uncle Sam is deciding what to order from a menu on the wall, titled “Bill of Fare.” The first item on the menu is “Cuba Steak,” accompanied by a map of Cuba. The second item on the menu is “Porto Rico Pig,” accompanied by a map of Puerto Rico. With pig’s feet drawn on the bottom, the map appears to be the outline of a pig. The third item on the menu is “Philippine Floating Islands,” accompanied by a map of the Philippines. The fourth item on the menu is “Sandwich Islands,” accompanied by a map of the Hawaiian Islands.Courtesy of the Library of Congress #LC-USZ62-91465 Document 5 Source: John Hay, United States Secretary of State, The Second Open Door Note, July 3, 1900. To the Representatives of the United States at Berlin, London, Paris, Rome, St. Petersburg, and Tokyo Washington, July 3, 1900 In this critical posture of affairs in China it is deemed appropriate to define the attitude of the United States as far as present circumstances permit this to be done. We adhere to the policy...of peace with the Chinese nation, of furtherance of lawful commerce, and of protection of lives and property of our citizens by all means guaranteed under extraterritorial treaty rights and by the law of nations.... Weregardthe condition at Pekin[g] as one of virtual anarchy.... The purpose of the President is...toact concurrently with the other powers; first, in opening up communication with Pekin[g] and rescuing the American officials, missionaries, and other Americans who are in danger; secondly, in affording all possible protection everywhere in China to American life and property; thirdly, in guarding and protecting all legitimate American interests; and fourthly, in aiding to prevent a spread of the disorders to the other provinces of the Empire and a recurrence of such disasters.... The policy of the Government of the United States is to seek a solution which may bring about permanent safety and peace to China, preserve Chinese territorial and administrative entity, protect all rights guaranteed to friendly powers by treaty and international law, and safeguard for the world the principle of equal and impartial trade with all parts of the Chinese Empire. Document 6 Source: Puck, a satirical magazine, November 20, 1901. The figure presents a political cartoon titled “It’s, quote, Up To, end quote, Them.” The cartoon shows a larger than life-size version of Uncle Sam, holding a person in each of his palms: a soldier with a gun in one and a woman labeled “school teacher” in the other. Uncle Sam faces a group of Filipino people, who appear to be looking at him curiously. A caption below the image reads “Uncle Sam, to Filipinos—You can take your choice;—I have plenty of both.”Courtesy of the Library of Congress #LC-DIG-ppmsca-25583 Document 7 Source: President Theodore Roosevelt, Fourth Annual Message to Congress, December 6, 1904. There are kinds of peace which are highly undesirable, which are in the long run as destructive as any war. Tyrants and oppressors have many times made a wilderness and called it peace. Many times peoples who were slothful or timid or shortsighted, who had been enervated by ease or by luxury, or misled by false teachings, have shrunk in unmanly fashion from doing duty that was stern and that needed self-sacrifice, and have sought to hide from their own minds their shortcomings, their ignoble motives, by calling them love of peace.... It is our duty to remember that a nation has no more right to do injustice to another nation, strong or weak, than an individual has to do injustice to another individual; that the same moral law applies in one case as in the other. But we must also remember that it is as much the duty of the Nation to guard its own rights and its own interests as it is the duty of the individual so to do.... It is not true that the United States feels any land hunger or entertains any projects as regards the other nations of the Western Hemisphere save such as are for their welfare. All that this country desires is to see the neighboring countries stable, orderly, and prosperous. Any country whose people conduct themselves well can count upon our hearty friendship. If a nation shows that it knows how to act with reasonable efficiency and decency in social and political matters, if it keeps order and pays its obligations, it need fear no interference from the United States. Chronic wrongdoing, or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society, may in America, as elsewhere, ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation, and...theexercise of an international police power. END OF DOCUMENTS FOR QUESTION 1 Question 2, 3, or 4 (Long Essay) Suggested writing time: 40 minutes Directions: Answer Question 2 or Question 3 or Question 4. In your response you should do the following. Respond to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning. Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. Support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant examples of evidence. Use historical reasoning (for example comparison, causation, continuity or change over time) to frame or structure an argument that addresses the prompt. Use evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the prompt. 2.
