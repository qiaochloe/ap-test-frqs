High scores will be earned only by essays that both cite key pieces of evidence from the documents and draw on outside knowledge of the period. 1. Historians have traditionally labeled the period after the War of 1812 the “Era of Good Feelings.” Evaluate the accuracy of this label, considering the emergence of nationalism and sectionalism. &#1;&#1;Use the documents and your knowledge of the period 1815-1825 to construct your answer. Document A Source:  John Randolph, Congress, 1816 Sir, I am convinced that it would be . . . unjust, to aggravate the burdens of the people for the purpose of favoring the manufacturers; for this government created and gave power to Congress to regulate commerce and equalize duties on the whole of the United States, and not to lay a duty but with a steady eye to revenue. With my goodwill, sir, [no] one interest in the country [should be] sacrificed by the management of taxation to another. . . . The agriculturalists bear the whole brunt of the war and taxation, and remain poor, while the others run in the ring of pleasure, and fatten upon them. Document B Source:  John C. Calhoun, Congress, February 4, 1817 Let it not be forgotten, let it be forever kept in mind, that the extent of the republic exposes us to the greatest of calamities—disunion. We are great, and rapidly—I was about to say fearfully—growing. This is our price and danger, our weakness and our strength. . . . We are under the most imperious obligations to counteract every tendency to disunion. . . . Whatever impedes the intercourse of the extremes with this, the center of the republic, weakens the union. . . . Let us, then, bind the republic together with a perfect system of roads and canals. Let us conquer space. Copyright © 2002 by College Entrance Examination Board. All rights reserved.

Maryland (1819) Has Congress the power to incorporate a bank? . . . In discussing this question, the council for the State of Maryland have deemed it of some importance, in the construction of the Constitution, to consider that instrument not as emanating from the people but as the act of sovereign and independent states. The powers of the general government, it has been said, are delegated by the states, who alone are truly sovereign; and must be exercised in subordination to the states, who alone possess supreme dominion. It would be difficult to sustain this proposition. Copyright © 2002 by College Entrance Examination Board. All rights reserved.

I considered it, at once as the [death] knell of the Union. It is hushed, indeed, for the moment. But this is a reprieve only, not a final sentence. A geographical line, coinciding with a marked principle, moral and political, once conceived and held up to the angry passions of men, will never be obliterated; and every new irritation will mark it deeper and deeper. Copyright © 2002 by College Entrance Examination Board.

I suppose that by this time you are anxious to hear more about the unhappy business which has filled with consternation all our city and nothing but the merciful interposition of our God has saved us from horror equal if not superior to the scenes acted in St. Domingo—The catalogue is not filled up for we thought that it was ended and that the execution of six of the chiefs would suffice. The court has been dismissed and the town was again sinking into its wonted security when information was given that another attempt would be made at such a time, and the state’s witness gave information of such a nature as to induce the city council to recall the court, and since that period the alarm has spread most widely, and there are now between 50 and 60 of the leaders in our jail—It is said that twenty of them have been convicted and sentenced, and in all probability the execution will not end under 100, but I was told yesterday that the prisoners had been heard to say that even should there be 500 executed there would be still enough to carry the work into execution. Document H Source:  Diary of John Quincy Adams, November 7, 1823 President [Monroe] was averse to any course which should have the appearance of taking a position subordinate to that of Great Britain, and suggested the idea of sending a special Minister to protest against the interposition of the Holy Alliance. . . . I remarked that the communication recently received from the Russian Minister . . . afforded a very suitable and convenient opportunity for us to take our stand against the Holy Alliance, and at the same time to decline the overture of Great Britain. Copyright © 2002 by College Entrance Examination Board.
