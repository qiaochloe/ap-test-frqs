The revolution was in the minds of the people, and this was effected from 1760 to 1775, in the course of fifteen years, before a drop of blood was shed at Lexington.” Former president John Adams to former president Thomas Jefferson, August 1815 “There is nothing more common than to confound the terms of the American Revolution with those of the late American war.
