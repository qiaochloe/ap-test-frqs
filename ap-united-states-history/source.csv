"Source: Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Sr., speech to the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, August 12, 1919. Mr. President: I have never had but one allegiance—I cannot divide it now. I have loved but one flag and I cannot share that devotion and give affection to the mongrel banner invented for a league. Internationalism, illustrated by the Bolshevik . . . is to me repulsive. . . . The United States is the world’s best hope, but if you fetter her in the interests and quarrels of other nations, if you tangle her in the intrigues of Europe, you will destroy her power for good and endanger her very existence. . . . No doubt many excellent and patriotic people see a coming fulfillment of noble ideals in the words “league for peace.” We all respect and share these aspirations and desires, but some of us see no hope, but rather defeat, for them in this murky covenant. For we, too, have our ideals, even if we differ from those who have tried to establish a monopoly of idealism.",B,DBQ,1,2014,ap14_frq_US_History.txt

The experience of the last war includes the lesson that neutral rights are not a matter for national protection unless we are prepared to protect them by force. . . .

Marshal Stalin said that he did not think the small nations of Europe would like the organization composed of the Four Policemen. . . .

Our position as the center of power in the free world places a heavy responsibility upon the United States for leadership. We must organize and enlist the energies and resources of the free world in a positive program for peace which will frustrate the Kremlin design for world domination by creating a situation in the free world to which the Kremlin will be compelled to adjust. Without such a cooperative effort, led by the United States, we will have to make gradual withdrawals under pressure until we discover one day that we have sacrificed positions of vital interest. It is imperative that this trend be reversed by a much more rapid and concerted build-up of the actual strength of both the United States and the other nations of the free world. . . . we must, by means of a rapid and sustained build-up of the political, economic, and military strength of the free world, and by means of an affirmative program intended to wrest the initiative from the Soviet Union, confront it with convincing evidence of the determination and ability of the free world to frustrate the Kremlin design of a world dominated by its will.",I,DBQ,1,2014,ap14_frq_US_History.txt

"Source: Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull-House, 1910, describing events in the 1890s. [The] Hull-House [social settlement] had instigated [a political campaign] against a powerful alderman who has held office for more than twenty years in the nineteenth ward, and who, although notoriously corrupt, is still firmly intrenched among his constituents.... We soon discovered that approximately one out of every five voters in the nineteenth ward at that time held a job dependent upon the good will of the alderman. There were no civil service rules to interfere, and the unskilled voter swept the street and dug the sewer, as secure in his position as the more sophisticated voter who tended a bridge or occupied an office chair in the city hall.... Another result of the campaign was an expectation on the part of our new political friends that Hull-House would perform like offices for them, and there resulted endless confusion and misunderstanding because in many cases we could not even attempt to do what the alderman constantly did with a right good will. When he protected a law breaker from the legal consequences of his act, his kindness appeared, not only to himself but to all beholders, like the deed of a powerful and kindly statesman. When Hull-House on the other hand insisted that a law must be enforced, it could but appear like the persecution of the offender. We were certainly not anxious for consistency nor for individual achievement, but in a desire to foster a higher political morality and not to lower our standards, we constantly clashed with the existing political code.",1,DBQ,1,2019,ap19-frq-us-history.txt

The great corporations which we have grown to speak of rather loosely as trusts are the creatures of the State, and the State not only has the right to control them, but it is in duty bound to control them wherever the need of such control is shown. There is clearly need of supervision—need to possess the power of regulation of these great corporations through the representatives of the public—wherever, as in our own country at the present time, business corporations become so very powerful alike for beneficent work and for work that is not always beneficent. It is idle to say that there is no need for such supervision.

"Source: Julian W. Mack, “The Juvenile Court,” Harvard Law Review, 1909. Why is it not just and proper to treat these juvenile offenders, as we deal with the neglected children, as a wise and merciful father handles his own child whose errors are not discovered by the authorities? Why is it not the duty of the state, instead of asking merely whether a boy or a girl has committed a specific offense, to find out what he is, physically, mentally, morally, and then if it learns that he is treading the path that leads to criminality, to take him in charge, not so much to punish as to reform, not to degrade but to uplift, not to crush but to develop, not to make him a criminal but a worthy citizen. And it is this thought—the thought that the child who has begun to go wrong, who is incorrigible, who has broken a law or an ordinance, is to be taken in hand by the state, not as an enemy but as a protector, as the ultimate guardian...;itis this principle, which...wasfirst fully and clearly declared, in the Act under which the Juvenile Court of Cook County, Illinois, was opened in Chicago on July 1, 1899.",3,DBQ,1,2019,ap19-frq-us-history.txt

When, with your assistance, California’s government shall be composed only of those who recognize one sovereign and master, the people, then is presented to us the question of, How best can we arm the people to protect themselves hereafter?... This means for accomplishing other reforms has been designated the “Initiative and the referendum,” and the precautionary measure by which a recalcitrant official can be removed is designated the “Recall.” And while I do not by any means believe the initiative, the referendum, and the recall are the panacea for all our political ills, yet they do give to the electorate the power of action when desired, and they do place in the hands of the people the means by which they may protect themselves. . . . The opponents of direct legislation and the recall, however they may phrase their opposition, in reality believe the people cannot be trusted.

Dear Mr. President: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, through its Board of Directors, respectfully protests against the policy of your Administration in segregating the colored employees in the Departments at Washington. It realizes that this new and radical departure has been recommended, and is now being defended, on the ground that by giving certain bureaus or sections wholly to colored employees they are thereby rendered safer in possession of their offices and are less likely to be ousted or discriminated against. We believe this reasoning to be fallacious.

When she and [her husband] Bob discovered, shortly after moving to [a suburb], that they were going to have a second child they began planning for it months in advance.... One of Helen’s greatest joys in her new home is the washing machine, which takes care of the family’s regular laundry...and is invaluable for all the slip covers, curtains, etc., that Helen plans to have spic and span before the baby comes.... Besides her house cleaning economies she saves time for the weekend by carefully planning her Saturday baking and by preparing casserole dishes and quick refrigerator desserts. “It means” she says, “that Bob and I have just about as much social life as we ever did. Naturally I don’t gad about, but there’s always time to have people over. On Saturday night we usually have a television party.

If at any one time of my life more than another, I was made to drink the bitterest dregs of slavery, that time was during the first six months of my stay with Mr. Covey [a White overseer]. . . . Mr. Covey succeeded in breaking me. I was broken in body, soul, and spirit. My natural elasticity was crushed, my intellect languished, the disposition to read departed, the cheerful spark that lingered about my eye died; the dark night of slavery closed in upon me; and behold a man transformed into a brute! . . . Long before daylight, I was called to . . . feed, the horses. . . . Mr. Covey entered the stable with a long rope; and . . . he caught hold of my legs, and was about tying me. . . . I gave a sudden spring, and as I did so, he holding to my legs, I was brought sprawling on the stable floor. Mr. Covey seemed now to think he had me, and could do what he pleased; but at this moment—from whence came the spirit I don’t know—I resolved to fight; and . . . I seized Covey hard by the throat; and as I did so, I rose. He held on to me, and I to him. My resistance was so entirely unexpected that Covey seemed taken all aback. He trembled like a leaf. This gave me assurance. . . . This battle with Mr. Covey was the turning-point in my career as a slave. It rekindled the few expiring embers of freedom, and revived within me a sense of my own manhood. It recalled the departed self-confidence, and inspired me again with a determination to be free. . . . It was a glorious resurrection, from the tomb of slavery, to the heaven of freedom.

The court has been dismissed and the town was again sinking into its wonted security when information was given that another attempt would be made at such a time, and the state’s witness gave information of such a nature as to induce the city council to recall the court, and since that period the alarm has spread most widely, and there are now between 50 and 60 of the leaders in our jail—It is said that twenty of them have been convicted and sentenced, and in all probability the execution will not end under 100, but I was told yesterday that the prisoners had been heard to say that even should there be 500 executed there would be still enough to carry the work into execution.",G,DBQ,1,2002,b_ushist_frq_02_10360.txt

"Source: Betty Friedan, UE (United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America) Fights for Women Workers, 1952. In advertisements across the land, industry glorifies the American woman—in her gleaming GE kitchen, at her Westinghouse laundromat, before her Sylvania television set. Nothing is too good for her—unless she works for GE, or Westinghouse, or Sylvania or thousands of other corporations throughout the U.S.A. As an employee, regardless of her skill, she is rated lower than common labor (male). She is assigned to jobs which, according to government studies, involve greater physical strain and skill than many jobs done by men—but she is paid less than the underpaid sweeper, the least skilled men in the plant. She is speeded up until she may faint at her machine, to barely earn her daily bread. Wage discrimination against women workers exists in every industry where women are employed. It exists because it pays off in billions of dollars in extra profits for the companies. According to the 1950 census, the average wage of women in factories was $1,285 a year less than men....In just one year, U.S. corporations made five billion four hundred million dollars in extra profits from their exploitation of women.",2,DBQ,1,2016,ap16_frq_us_history.txt
"Source: “Sex and Caste: A Kind of Memo from Casey Hayden and Mary King to a number of other women in the peace and freedom movements,” 1965. Women we’ve talked to who work in the [peace and civil rights] movement seem to be caught up in a common-law caste system that operates, sometimes subtly, forcing them to work around or outside hierarchical structures of power which may exclude them. Women seem to be placed in the same position of assumed subordination in personal situations too. It is a caste system which, at its worst, uses and exploits women. The caste system perspective dictates the roles assigned to women in the [peace and civil rights] movement, and certainly even more to women outside the movement. Within the movement, questions arise in situations ranging from relationships of women organizers to men in the community, to who cleans the freedom house, to who holds leadership positions, to who does secretarial work, and who acts as spokesman [spokesperson] for groups. Other problems arise between women with varying degrees of awareness of themselves as being as capable as men but held back from full participation, or between women who see themselves as needing more control of their work than other women demand.

In case of arrests, however, we plan to reject all male authority and demand to be busted by policewomen only. Male chauvinist-reactionaries on this issue had best stay away, nor are male liberals welcome in the demonstrations. But sympathetic men can donate money as well as cars and drivers.

The oppression suffered by Chicanas is different from that suffered by most women in this country.

Tyrants and oppressors have many times made a wilderness and called it peace. Many times peoples who were slothful or timid or shortsighted, who had been enervated by ease or by luxury, or misled by false teachings, have shrunk in unmanly fashion from doing duty that was stern and that needed self-sacrifice, and have sought to hide from their own minds their shortcomings, their ignoble motives, by calling them love of peace.... It is our duty to remember that a nation has no more right to do injustice to another nation, strong or weak, than an individual has to do injustice to another individual; that the same moral law applies in one case as in the other. But we must also remember that it is as much the duty of the Nation to guard its own rights and its own interests as it is the duty of the individual so to do.... It is not true that the United States feels any land hunger or entertains any projects as regards the other nations of the Western Hemisphere save such as are for their welfare. All that this country desires is to see the neighboring countries stable, orderly, and prosperous. Any country whose people conduct themselves well can count upon our hearty friendship. If a nation shows that it knows how to act with reasonable efficiency and decency in social and political matters, if it keeps order and pays its obligations, it need fear no interference from the United States.

Harlots, and drunkards, and infidels, and all sorts of abandoned characters, are awakened and converted.",B,DBQ,1,2002,ushist_frq_02_10359.txt

"Source: Samuel F.B. Morse, Imminent Dangers to the Free Institutions of the United States, 1835. In our national infancy we needed the strength of numbers. . . . Now emigration is changed; naturalization has become the door of entrance not alone to the ever welcome lovers of liberty, but also for the priest-ridden troops of the Holy Alliance. . . . Now emigrants are selected . . . not for their affinity to liberty, but for their mental servitude, and their docility in obeying the orders of their priests. . . . It may be, Americans, that you still doubt the existence of a conspiracy. . . . Do you wish to test its existence and its power? . . . Test it by attempting a change in the Naturalization Law. Take the ground that such a change must be made, that no foreigner who comes into the country after the law is passed shall ever be allowed the right of suffrage.",D,DBQ,1,2002,ushist_frq_02_10359.txt
"Source: William H. McGuffey, Reader, 1836. The good boy, whose parents are poor, rises very early in the morning, and all day long does as much as he can to help his father and mother. When he goes to school he walks quickly, and does not lose time on the road. “My parents,” he says, “are very good to save some of their money in order that I may learn to read and write; but they can not give much, nor can they spare me long; therefore I must learn as fast as I can; if anybody has any time to lose, I am sure I have not.” . . . When he has finished his lessons, he does not stay to play, but runs home; he wants to see his father and mother and to help them. . . . Sometimes he goes with his father to work; then he is very glad and though he is but a little fellow, he works very hard, almost like a man. . . . When he comes home to dinner, he says, “How hungry I am! And how good this bread is, and this bacon! Indeed, I think every thing we have is very good. I am glad I can work; I hope that I shall soon be able to earn all my clothes, and my food too.” When he sees little boys and girls riding on pretty horses, or in coaches, or walking with ladies and gentlemen, and having on very fine clothes, he does not envy them, nor wish to be like them. He says, “I have often been told, and I have read, that it is God who makes some poor, and others rich; that the rich have many troubles which we know nothing of; and that the poor, if they are but good, may be very happy, indeed, I think that when I am good, nobody can be happier than I am.”",E,DBQ,1,2002,ushist_frq_02_10359.txt

"Source: Orestes A. Brownson, An address before the Society of the Mystical Seven at Wesleyan College, August 7, 1844. I propose . . . to bestow . . . my remarks, my attention on several species of the genus QUACK REFORMERS. . . . The effort to cut loose from the past, and to create an entirely new social and industrial order . . . is the species of quackery practiced by our professed social reformers . . . . These systems of reform disown the past, condemn what has been, and propose the creation of an entirely new social order. . . . It is to no man’s credit that he disowns what has gone before him. . . . But what is this past which we in our folly condemn? It is that which has made us what we are. It is our mother. . . . Alas! He is a bad son who curses his own mother, and no good can come of him.",G,DBQ,1,2002,ushist_frq_02_10359.txt

But we are assembled to protest against a form of government, existing without the consent of the governed—to declare our right to be free as man is free, to be represented in the government which we are taxed to support, to have such disgraceful laws as give man the power to chastise and imprison his wife. . . . And, strange as it may seem to many, we now demand our right to vote according to the declaration of the government under which we live.",I,DBQ,1,2002,ushist_frq_02_10359.txt
