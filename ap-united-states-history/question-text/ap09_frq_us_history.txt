He replied that he would. I was then very happy, knowing that I was at that time able to pay part of the purchase money by means of the money which I had some time buried. . . .

Martin said there was this expression in the Bible, delays breed danger; at this time, he said, the country was at peace, the soldiers were discharged, and the arms all put away; there was no patrolling in the country, and that before he would any longer bear what he had borne, he would turn out and fight with his stick . . .

Will it not be dreadful for you? I speak, Americans, for your good. We must and shall be free I say, in spite of you. You may do your best to keep us in wretchedness and misery, to enrich you and your children; but God will deliver us from you. And woe, woe, will be to you if we have to obtain our freedom by fighting. END OF DOCUMENTS FOR QUESTION 1 © 2009 The College Board. All rights reserved.
