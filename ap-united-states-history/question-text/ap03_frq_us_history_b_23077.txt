These floors, it must be noted, were in most cases damp and soggy, in dark, ill-ventilated rooms, and the employees in utter ignorance of cleanliness or danger to health, expectorated at will upon them. In a word, we saw meat shoveled from filthy wooden floors, piled on tables rarely washed, pushed from room to room in rotten box carts, in all of which processes it was in the way of gathering dirt, splinters, floor filth, and the expectoration of tuberculosis and other diseased workers. Document C Source:  Jane Addams, The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets, 1909. Knowing as educators do that thousands of the city youth will enter factory life at an early age as early as the state law will permit; instructed as the modern teacher is as to youth’s requirements for normal mental and muscular development, it is hard to understand the apathy in regard to youth’s inevitable experience in modern industry. Are the educators, like the rest of us, so caught in admiration of the astonishing achievements of modern industry that they forget the children themselves? Document D Source:  Speech by Theodore Roosevelt, February 22, 1912. I believe in providing for direct nominations by the people, including therein direct presidential primaries for the election of delegates to the national nominating conventions. . . . I believe in the election of United States senators by direct vote. Just as actual experience convinced our people that presidents should be elected (as they are now in practice, although not in theory) by direct vote of the people instead of by indirect vote through an untrammeled electoral college, so actual experience has convinced us that senators should be elected by direct vote of the people instead of indirectly through the various legislatures. Document E Source: Clayton Antitrust Act, October 15, 1914 That it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities which commodities are sold for use, consumption, or resale within the United States, where the effect of such discrimination may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce. . . . That the labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce. Nothing contained in the antitrust laws shall be construed to forbid the existence and operation of labor organizations. Document F Source:  Herbert Croly, New Republic, Nov. 21, 1914. How can a man of President Wilson’s intelligence possibly delude himself into believing the extravagant claims which he makes on behalf of the Democratic legislative achievement? . . . How many sincere progressives follow him in believing that this legislation has made the future clear and bright with the promise of best things? . . . After every allowance has been made for his justifiable pride . . . there remains an ominous residue of sheer misunderstanding. Any man of President Wilson’s intellectual equipment who seriously asserts that the fundamental wrongs of a modern society can be easily and quickly righted as a consequence of a few laws . . . casts suspicion either upon his own sincerity or upon his grasp of the realities of modern social and industrial life. Document G Source:  Hammer v. Dagenhart, 1918. [Suit was brought] by a father in his own behalf and . . . his two minor sons, one under the age of fourteen years and the other between the age of fourteen and sixteen years, employees in a cotton mill at Charlotte, North Carolina, to enjoin [stop] the enforcement of the act of Congress intended to prevent interstate commerce in the products of child labor. . . . The controlling question for this decision, is it within the authority of Congress in regulating commerce among the states to prohibit the transportation in interstate commerce of manufactured goods, the product of a factory in which . . . children under the age of fourteen and sixteen years have been employed or permitted to work more than eight hours in any day, or more than six days in any week? In our view, the necessary effect of this act is purely a state authority. Thus, the act in a two-fold sense is repugnant to the Constitution. . . . [I]t not only transcends the authority delegated to Congress over commerce, but also exerts a power as to a purely local matter. Document H GO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE. Document I Source:  W.E.B. DuBois, The Crisis, May 1919. We are returning from war!  The Crisis and tens of thousands of black men were drafted into a great struggle. For bleeding France and what she means and has meant and will mean to us and humanity and against the threat of German race arrogance, we fought gladly and to the last drop of blood; for America and her highest ideals, we fought in far-off hope; for the dominant Southern oligarchy entrenched in Washington, we fought in bitter resignation.  For the America that represents and gloats in lynching, disfranchisement, caste, brutality and devilish insult - for this, in the hateful upturning and mixing of things, we were forced by vindictive fate to fight also. But today we return! . . . This country of ours, despite all its better souls have done and dreamed, is yet a shameful land. Document J END OF DOCUMENTS FOR QUESTION 1 UNITED STATES HISTORY SECTION II Part B and Part C (Suggested total planning and writing time—70 minutes) Percent of Section II score—55 Part B Directions:  Choose ONE question from this part.
