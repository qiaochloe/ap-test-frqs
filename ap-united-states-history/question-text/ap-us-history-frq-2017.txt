The test preparation materials  in this document include images for which descriptions are provided. In a standard test, the images are presented without descriptions. In this document, descriptions are included with the images so that assistive technology users will have an understanding of what is in each image. However, some of the image descriptions may not be valid for testing purposes; and in certain cases we cannot make all of the content accessible due to the construct or design of particular test questions.  Therefore, on an actual test in an alternate format, some questions may be omitted if they include images that cannot be described without affecting the question’s validity. If any questions are omitted, the scoring rules for the test take such omissions into account to make sure that you are neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by the omissions and that your scores are comparable to those of individuals taking another version of the test.A P.

 The figure presents a political cartoon titled “The ‘Strong’ Government, 1869 through 1877.” In the cartoon, a military leader, Ulysses S. Grant is shown sitting atop a large bag, which is being carried on a woman’s shoulders. The bag is labeled “Carpet Bag and Bayonet Rule,” and is filled with many bayonets that are rolled up in parchments labeled “Rule or Ruin.” The woman who is carrying the bag is labeled “The Solid South,” and appears to be struggling to stay standing due to the weight of the bag and the sharp rocks lining her path. Two United States soldiers are standing on either side of the bag and are holding bayonets that have shackles on them, which lead to the woman’s arms. In the background is a military campsite with cannons and soldiers guarding a large bulding labeled “Halls of Justice” as well as the outlines of burned buildings. Further in the background are two steamships, one of which appears to be sinking.Courtesy of the Library of Congress The figure presents a political cartoon titled “The ‘Weak’ Government, 1877 through 1881.” In the cartoon, President Rutheford B.

Policymakers... shared a common...conviction that the United States not only should, but could, control political conditions in South Vietnam, as elsewhere throughout much of the world. This conviction had led Washington to intervene progressively deeper in South Vietnamese affairs over the years....This  conviction prompted policymakers to escalate the war.... Domestic political pressures exerted an equally powerful... influence over the course of U.S. involvement in Vietnam....Another  ‘loss’ to communism in East Asia risked renewed and devastating attacks from the right.” Brian VanDeMark, historian, Into the Quagmire, 1995 “The escalation of U.S. military intervention [in Vietnam] grew out of a complicated chain of events and a complex web of decisions that slowly transformed the conflict... into an American war.... [President Lyndon Johnson] made the critical decisions that took the United States into war almost without realizing it. . . . Although impersonal forces... influenced the president’s Vietnam decisions, those decisions depended primarily on his character, his motivations, and his relationships with his principal advisers....T hewarin Vietnam was not lost in the field, nor was it lost on the front pages of The New York Times or on the college campuses. It was lost in Washington, D.C., even before Americans assumed sole responsibility for the fighting.” H. R. McMaster, historian, Dereliction of Duty, 1997 4.Using the excerpts, answer (a), (b), and (c).a)	 Briefly explain ONE major difference between VanDeMark’s and McMaster’s historical interpretations of theUnited States involvement in the Vietnam War.b)	 Briefly explain how ONE historical event or development in the period 1945 to 1975 that is not explicitlymentioned in the excerpts could be used to support VanDeMark’s interpretation.c)	 Briefly explain how ONE historical event or development in the period 1945 to 1975 that is not explicitlymentioned in the excerpts could be used to support McMaster’s interpretation.END OF SECTION I

When men enter into society, it is by voluntary consent; and they have a right to demand and insist upon the performance of such conditions and previous limitations as form an equitable original compact.... The natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on earth, and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man, but only to have the law of nature for his rule. Document 4 Source: Quaker leaders, address to the Pennsylvania colonial assembly, January 1775. Having considered, with real sorrow, the unhappy contest between the legislature of Great Britain and the people of these colonies, and the animosities consequent therein, we have by repeated public advices and private admonitions, used our endeavors to dissuade the members of our religious society from joining with the public resolutions promoted and entered into by some of the people, which as we apprehended, and so we now find, have increased contention, and produced great discord and confusion.... We are therefore incited by a sincere concern for the peace and welfare of our country, publicly to declare against every usurpation of power and authority in opposition to the laws and government, and against all combinations, insurrections, conspiracies, and illegal assemblies; and as we are restrained from them by the conscientious discharge of our duty to Almighty God, “by whom kings reign and princes decree justice,” we hope...to maintain...thefidelity we owe to the King and his government, as by law established; earnestly desiring the restoration of that harmony and concord which have heretofore united the people of these provinces. Document 5 Source: Janet Schaw, Journal of a Lady of Quality, June 1775. Schaw was a Scot visiting her brother, a merchant, in Wilmington, North Carolina. At present the martial law stands thus: An officer or committeeman enters a plantation with his posse. The alternative is proposed. Agree to join us [the Patriots] and your persons and properties are safe...ifyou refuse, we are directly to cut up your corn, shoot your pigs, burn your houses, seize your Negroes and perhaps tar and feather yourself. Not to choose the first requires more courage than they are possessed of, and I believe this method has seldom failed with the lower sort. Document 6 Source: Charles Inglis, Anglican church minister in New York City, The Costs of Revolution, 1776. Where the money is to come from which will defray this enormous annual expense of three millions sterling [for the American Revolution], and all those other debts, I know not.... Certain I am that our commerce and agriculture, the two principal sources of our wealth, will not support such an expense. The whole of our exports from the Thirteen United Colonies, in the year 1769, amounted only to £2,887,898 sterling; which is not so much, by near half a million, as our annual expense would be were we independent of Great Britain. Those exports, with no inconsiderable part of the profits arising from them, it is well known, centered finally in Britain to pay the merchants and manufacturers there for goods we had imported thence—and yet left us still in debt! What then must our situation be, or what the state of our trade, when oppressed with such a burden of annual expense! When every article of commerce, every necessary of life, together with our lands, must be heavily taxed to defray that expense! Document 7 Source: Thomas Paine, The American Crisis, December 23, 1776. These are the times that try men’s souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated. Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right (not only to tax) but “to bind us in all cases whatsoever.” END OF DOCUMENTS FOR QUESTION 1
