"Source: John Evelyn, writer and founding member of the Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge, diary entry, 1688 7th October—Dr. Tenison [an Anglican minister] preached at St. Martin’s church, showing the Scriptures to be our only rule of faith, and its perfection above all traditions. After which, near 1,000 devout persons partook of the Communion. The sermon was chiefly a response to a sermon by a Jesuit, who the Sunday before had disparaged the Scripture and railed at our translation. Some who were present [on that Sunday] pulled the Jesuit out of the pulpit, and treated him very coarsely. Hourly expectation of William, the Prince of Orange’s invasion heightened to that degree, that his Majesty [James II] thought fit to dispense with all laws and in the meantime, he called over 5,000 Irish and 4,000 Scots soldiers, and continued to remove Protestants and put in Papists at Portsmouth harbor and other places of trust, and retained the Jesuits about him, increasing the universal discontent. It brought people to so desperate a pass, that they seemed passionately to long for and desire the landing of the Prince of Orange, whom they looked on to be their deliverer from Popish tyranny, praying incessantly for an east wind, which was said to be the only hindrance of his expedition [from the Netherlands] with a numerous army ready to make a descent.",1,DBQ,1,2017,ap-european-history-frq-2017.txt

"Source: John Locke, English writer, Two Treatises of Government, 1689 The reason why men enter into society, is the preservation of their property; and the end why they choose and authorize a legislative power, is, that there may be laws made, and rules set, as guards and fences to the properties of all the members of the society, to limit the power, and moderate the dominion, of every nd member of the society: for since it can never be supposed to be the will of the society, that the legislative should have a power to destroy that which every one designs to secure, by entering into society, and for which the people submitted themselves to legislators of their own making; whenever the legislators endeavour to take away, and destroy the property of the people, or to reduce them to slavery under arbitrary power, they put themselves into a state of war with the people, who are thereupon absolved from any farther obedience, and are left to the common refuge, which God hath provided for all men, against force and violence....the supreme executor, who having a double trust put in him, both to have a part in the legislative, and the supreme execution of the law, acts against both, when he goes about to set up his own arbitrary will as the law of the society.",5,DBQ,1,2017,ap-european-history-frq-2017.txt

"“The welfare state, in short, was born of a cross-party twentieth-century consensus.... Moreover, and here the memory of war once again played an important role, the twentieth-century ‘socialist’ welfare states were constructed not as an advance guard of egalitarian revolution but to provide a barrier against the return of the past: against economic depression and its polarizing, violent political outcome in the desperate politics of Fascism and Communism alike. The welfare states were thus prophylactic [preventive].... Thanks to a half century of prosperity and safety, we in the West have forgotten the political and social traumas of mass insecurity. And thus we have forgotten why we have inherited those welfare states and what brought them about.” Tony Judt, British historian, Reappraisals: Reﬂections on the Forgotten Twentieth Century, 2008",0,SAQ,3,2017,ap-european-history-frq-2017.txt
"“For if Tycho Brahe,* considering the immensity of those globes [the planets], believed that they did not exist pointlessly in the world, but were packed with inhabitants, how much more convincing will it be for us, perceiving the variety of the works and intentions of God on this globe of Earth, to adopt a similar conjecture about the others as well? For He has created species to inhabit the waters, though there is no place under them for air, which living things draw in; He has sent into the immensity of the air birds propped up by feathers; He has given to the snowy tracts of the north white bears and white foxes....HasHe then used up all His skill on the globe of the Earth?

One noticed, in fact, that the people who got involved in the disturbances no longer came, as one might expect, from the inferior classes. Law students, students at the veterinary school and youngsters from good city families had joined in. Seditious shouts had arisen in certain groups, and we learned that the new troublemakers meant to keep the charivari going until King Louis Philippe’s birthday, in hopes of producing another sort of disorder. It was especially on the evening of Sunday the 28th of April 1833 that the political nature of these gatherings appeared unequivocally. All of a sudden shouts of LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC were heard.

The telescope (an optick invention) has been found out, by help of which many remarkable things in the heavens... were discovered....By this same instrument it appears very probable that Venus and Mercury do not move properly about the Earth, but rather about the sun; and that the Moon alone moveth about the Earth... Now there is no better or more convenient hypothesis than that of Copernicus. Because of this, many modern authors are induced to approve of, and follow it: but with much hesitancy and fear, because it seems to contradict the Holy Scriptures, and it cannot possibly be reconciled to them.

Second, I say that, as you know, the Council [of Trent] prohibits interpreting Scripture against the common consensus of the Holy Fathers.... Third, I say that if it were clearly demonstrated that the sun is at the center of the universe and the earth in the third orbit, and that the sun does not circle the earth but the earth circles the sun, then one would have to proceed with great care in explaining the Scriptures that appear contrary, and say rather that we do not understand those passages of Scripture, rather than say that what is demonstrated is false.

"Source: Galileo Galilei, Italian mathematician, astronomer, and physicist, letter to the Grand Duchess Christina of Tuscany, 1615 The reason produced for condemning the opinion that the earth moves and the sun stands still is that in many places in the Bible one may read that the sun moves and the earth stands still. Since the Bible cannot err, it follows as necessary the consequence that anyone takes an erroneous and heretical position who maintains that the sun is inherently motionless and the earth movable. With regard to this argument, I think in the first place that it is very pious to say and prudent to affirm that the holy Bible can never speak untruth—whenever its true meaning is understood. But I believe nobody will deny that it is often very abstruse, and may say things which are quite different from what its bare words signify. Hence in expounding the Bible if one were always to confine oneself to the unadorned grammatical meaning, one might fall into error.... I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with senses, reason, and intellect has intended to forgo their use by some other means to give us knowledge which we can attain by them. He would not require us to deny sense and reason in physical matters which are set before our eyes and minds by direct experience or necessary demonstrations.",4,DBQ,1,2019,ap19-frq-european-history.txt

They are distasteful to mathematics, because mathematics cannot be used to explain natural things without great disturbance of the traditional order. They are distasteful to theology, because Descartes’ reasoning attributes too much to the chance combination of atoms, which favors the atheist.

The fact that in the last elections one-fifth of the German people declared their support for the Social Democratic Party is mainly the fault of the Bismarckian system of government; it boosted socialism artificially by offering the carrot one moment and applying the stick the next. Existing religious differences were exacerbated through the battle over church policy, carried out by way of the police and criminal regulations.

Everything in the outward appearance of the city attests to the individual powers of man; nothing to the directing power of society. Nowhere do you see happy ease taking his leisurely walk in the streets of the city or going to seek simple enjoyment in the surrounding country. A multitude passes along without stopping; it looks abstracted, its aspect somber and uncouth. From this foul drain the greatest stream of human industry flows out to fertilize the whole world. From this filthy sewer pure gold flows.

They live suspended between an insufficiency of food and an excess of strong drink; they are all wizened, sickly and emaciated, their bodies thin and frail, their limbs feeble, their complexions pale, their eyes dead.

Then an explosion took place in the university milieu. It was provoked by certain groups that were in revolt against this modern society, whether communist in the East or capitalist in the West. These groups have no idea at all what they would replace modern society with, but they are groups that delight in negation, destruction, violence, and anarchy, and they fly the anarchists’ black flag.",12,DBQ,1,2009,ap09_frq_european_history_formb.txt
