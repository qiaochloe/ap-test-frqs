(Some of the documents have been edited for the purpose of this exercise.) Write your answer on the lined pages of the Section II free-response booklet. This question is designed to test your ability to work with and understand historical documents. Write an essay that: • Has a relevant thesis and supports that thesis with evidence from the documents. • Uses a majority of the documents. • Analyzes the documents by grouping them in as many appropriate ways as possible. Does not simply summarize the documents individually. • Takes into account both the sources of the documents and the authors’ points of view. You may refer to relevant historical information not mentioned in the documents. 1. Analyze the ways in which various people viewed the character and condition of Greeks in the Ottoman Empire during the Greek movement for independence in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Historical Background:  During the eighteenth century, Greeks living in exile began to appeal to their fellow Greeks to free themselves from Ottoman rule. Greek nationalists urged Greeks living throughout the Balkans and Asia Minor to revolt against their Turkish Muslim rulers. An uprising in March 1821 began a nine-year war for independence. Several thousand European volunteers fought on the Greek side, while many more (known collectively as Philhellenes—“lovers of Greece”) raised money and spread pro-Greek views in Europe. Intervention by Russian, French and English forces in 1827 and 1828 ultimately forced the Turks to grant Greek independence, which was formally established by a multipower treaty in 1830. Copyright © 2001 by College Entrance Examination Board.

Trace her dark streets, her ruined shrines; And wonder, where her glories shined. Where are her orators, her sages, now? Shattered her mouldering arches, her towers in dust, But far less ruin’d, than her soul decayed. Upon the mount where once the muses sung, Sits the gruff Turkish captain, and exacts Harsh tribute! In the grove where Plato* taught A stupid Turk is preaching ignorance. *Philosopher of ancient Greece Document 2 Source:  Mustapha III, the Turkish sultan, orders his governor in northern Greece to repress raids by Greeks, 1765. Most excellent general and governor of Thessalonika:  With the arrival of my imperial decree be it known that robbers continually incite the district of Larissa to rebellion. Impose order and report on the measures taken. Take care that affronts or arbitrary acts do not take place against those who are innocent of this robbery, but arrest and imprison these brigands and take back the stolen goods and animals, as well as any ransom money, cleansing the place of evildoers. Report on this to my capital. Document 3 Source:  Claude Etienne Savary, French scholar of Greek and Arabic, letter, 1788. Let me not be accused of painting the Turks in darker colors than they deserve, but I have traveled through their empire and have seen the injuries of every kind which they have done to the sciences, the arts, and the human race. At the sight of these melancholy spectacles my heart groans, my blood boils in my veins and I would wish to excite all Europe to combine against these Turks who have crushed the Greek nation. Copyright © 2001 by College Entrance Examination Board.

In conversation not a word about the commandments of God. The young, the educated, Do not go to Church, for they have got French enlightenment. They say, “We have books and French romances, All the other books are so melancholy! We are enlightened, And the old writers were all hypocrites!” They boast of being the pupils of Rousseau, And Voltaire even if they do not understand them, neither Have they ever read them. They say “I speak French and I will wear clothes in the European style.” Document 5 Source:  James Dallaway, chaplain to the English community in Constantinople, letter to an English friend, 1797. In the present age, in some respects, the Greeks experience greater toleration than the conquered subjects of any other nation, but they have in no degree recovered their former energy. The richer Greeks are very devious and intriguing, and with very limited exception, only less ignorant than their Turkish masters. The lower ranks are the merriest creatures imaginable, but are untrustworthy, and awake to every advantage. Document 6 Source: Greek exiles, The Greek Monarchy or A Word about Freedom, pamphlet published in Italy, 1806. The Ottoman state today finds itself in its death throes. O Greeks, learn forever that the weapons of justice are unconquerable, and that the Ottomans will flee from the armed Greeks. Remember, finally, that the beginning of victory is resistance, and that the Greeks are neither savage nor of worthless spirit, as are their enemies. Freedom has approached her ancient home. The echo of the trumpet of Ares* has awakened the heroes of our ancestors from their tombs. The hour has approached, O Greeks, for the liberation of our motherland! *God of war in Greek mythology Copyright © 2001 by College Entrance Examination Board.

Our laws, our literature, our religion, our arts have their roots in Greece. The modern Greek is the descendant of those glorious beings whom the mind almost refuses to imagine as belonging to our kind, and he inherits much of their sensibility, and their courage. Russia desires to possess, not to liberate, Greece; and the wise and generous policy of England would consist in establishing the independence of Greece, and in maintaining it against both Russia and the Turks. Document 8 Source:  Edward Blaquiere, English organizer and fundraiser for the London Greek Committee, Greek Revolution, 1824. The fortress of Navarino, which surrendered soon after the uprising began in 1821, was the scene of another tragedy, to which only wars between slaves and their masters ever give rise. During the siege, news of the murder of the head of the Greek Orthodox Church by the sultan’s government spread throughout Greece. The fury of the Greek troops, worked up to madness, was therefore vented on the Turkish garrison, of whom a considerable number were massacred. Copyright © 2001 by College Entrance Examination Board.

Persuaded by certain very old and mythical prophecies of theirs that the time for the liberation of the Greek nation and for its freedom had arrived, this revolution was none other than drunkards (O the blasphemy of it!) shamelessly roaming about and cheering. *Pasha is a government title. Document 10 Source:  Alexander Mavrocordato, president of the Greek revolutionary government, Declaration to the Christian Powers, April 15, 1822. For the last thirteen months, God has aided the work of the righteous. Her cities sacked, her villages burnt, her population decimated, bear witness to Greece’s proud determination. Crushed by numbers, she will yet wash out her defeats in her blood. What will be the feelings of Europe towards her? Assembled Greece has solemnly proclaimed her independence and has given herself a government. The Greeks aim at peace combined with independence and civilization. In a word, humanity, religion, interest all plead in their favor. Copyright © 2001 by College Entrance Examination Board.
