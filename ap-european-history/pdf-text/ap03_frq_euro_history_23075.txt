How did the French, including Marshal Philippe Pétain, view the Vichy regime that he led from 1940 to 1944 ? Historical Background: In May 1940 Germany defeated France’s armies and drove  its government from Paris. In June, eighty-four-year-old Marshal* Philippe Pétain was named prime minister. He arranged an armistice and agreed to German military occupation of more than half of France. In July, in a new capital at Vichy, Pétain became Chief of the French State (a regime without a legislature or constitution) until France’s 1944 liberation by the Allies. Pétain was condemned to death for treason in 1945, but Provisional President Charles de Gaulle commuted his sentence to life in prison, where he died in 1951. *Marshal (Maréchal de France) is the highest rank in the French army. Copyright © 2003 by College Entrance Examination Board.

Today I am assuming the direction of the Government of France. Sure of the affection of our admirable army, which is fighting with heroism against an enemy superior  in numbers and arms, sure that by its magnificent resistance it has fulfilled our obligations towards our allies, sure of the support of the veterans whom I had the honor to command, sure of the confidence of the whole people, I make to France the gift of my person, to relieve her suffering. It is with a heavy heart that I say to you today that the combat must cease. Rally to the Government over which I preside during these harsh trials, suppress your anguish and have faith in the destiny of our fatherland. Document 2 Source:  Philippe Pétain, Prime Minister and French Chief of State, radio address, Vichy, October 11, 1940.  Frenchmen! Four months ago, France suffered one of the most serious defeats in her history.  In truth, the disaster was simply the reflection of the weaknesses and defects of the former regime. War and defeat have merely hastened the coming of the National Revolution toward which the country was headed. Today we must rebuild France on a heap of ruins. The new order can in no way return to the mistakes which have cost us so dearly. It cannot be a slavish imitation of foreign experiments, though some of these experiments are not without merit and beauty. A new order is an absolute necessity for France. Document 3 Source:  General Charles de Gaulle, head of the Free French Movement, radio broadcast from French West Africa, October 27, 1940. We are living through the most terrible days in our history. At this very moment, the pathetic and miserable men who claim to constitute the French government at Vichy have been bullied into humiliating negotiations with the enemy. Such base servitude will give birth to even greater servitude in the future. We do not yet know what appalling concessions the enemy will force from those who have accepted his domination, but we can be sure that any one of them would inspire our nation’s outrage. Before long, the world will behold a dishonored and despairing France, a demented slave in Hitler’s grip. Copyright © 2003 by College Entrance Examination Board. All rights reserved.

Unsmiling he gazed at the frenzied crowd, then saluted it with his cane. His snow-white hair, his light-blue eyes and his tranquil bearing were impressive. But just what lay behind that impassive look? After all, had not the hand holding that cane just shaken the hand of Hitler at Montoiresur-le-Loir? Had not Pétain said our collaboration with Hitler must be sincere? And yet, was he himself sincere? Or was he merely trying to deceive the Führer? What were the real designs of this old man who held in his hands the destiny of France? Document 6 Copyright © 2003 by College Entrance Examination Board. All rights reserved.

When your government has no army, no navy, you have no means to protect our citizens against foreign police stationed everywhere on our territory, or protect our sons against the hardship of deportation, or our wealth against German confiscation. When you serve the will of a powerful enemy rather than our own national interest, then only the shadow of a government is left.  Not only should this government not be obeyed; we have a duty to  disobey it. Be united? We would be, if we were not told it is our duty to collaborate with the enemy. Obey? Yes, but only leaders who truly serve the French people. Be united? Yes, but only in the service of France. Document 8 Source:  Pierre-Antoine Cousteau, French fascist, article in the newspaper I Am Everywhere, May 5, 1944. I don’t think the Marshal has any great fondness for the Germans. As a valiant and noble soldier, he must admire the exceptional military abilities of this great people, but more than anyone, he must suffer from this military occupation. But it is not enough to wish that the Germans depart. If their departure opened the door to Communism, the remedy would be worse than the disease. We too wish to have the Germans depart, but only their victory can save France from disaster. That is what the Marshal has explicitly proclaimed, and who dares to call the hero of the First World War a sell-out or a traitor? Last Friday, he told us that he supports “the defense of our continent by Germany!” Copyright © 2003 by College Entrance Examination Board. All rights reserved.

I asked for nothing and wanted nothing. I was begged to come; I came. I became the heir to  a catastrophe for which I was not responsible. The Armistice saved France and contributed  to the Allied victory by ensuring that part of France and the empire remained free and intact. Power was entrusted to me lawfully and recognized by every country in the world from the Vatican to the Soviet Union. I used that power as a shield to protect the French people.  I remained at the head of an occupied country. While General de Gaulle, outside our  frontiers, carried on the struggle, I prepared the way for the liberation, by preserving an unhappy, but living, France. Document 11 Source:  Pierre Laval, Vichy Prime Minister, legal deposition before his trial and execution, September 1945. I noticed at once that the Marshal had no regard for republican legality. I came to this conclusion from the pretentiousness and outdated style of his first decrees —“We, Philippe Pétain” — even more than the large share of power he took for himself. An enormous propaganda campaign was organized throughout the country to aggrandize the Marshal. It was said that  he embodied France. He alone could save the country. His picture, his bust were everywhere. There was even a national song, “Marshal, Here We Are.” There was a special decoration, the “Order of the Marshal.” I doubt that such a great propaganda effort on behalf of any other man was ever undertaken in France. END OF PART A Copyright © 2003 by College Entrance Examination Board.
