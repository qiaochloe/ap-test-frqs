The test preparation materials  in this document include images for which descriptions are provided. In a standard test, the images are presented without descriptions. In this document, descriptions are included with the images so that assistive technology users will have an understanding of what is in each image. However, some of the image descriptions may not be valid for testing purposes; and in certain cases we cannot make all of the content accessible due to the construct or design of particular test questions.  Therefore, on an actual test in an alternate format, some questions may be omitted if they include images that cannot be described without affecting the question’s validity. If any questions are omitted, the scoring rules for the test take such omissions into account to make sure that you are neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by the omissions and that your scores are comparable to those of individuals taking another version of the test.A P logoAP® European History 2015 Free-Response Questions © 2015 The College Board.

The documents have been edited for the purpose of this exercise. Write your answer on the lined pages of the Section II free-response booklet. This question is designed to test your ability to work with and understand historical documents. Write an essay that: Provides an appropriate, explicitly stated thesis that directly addresses all parts of the question and does NOT simply restate the question. Discusses a majority of the documents individually and specifically. Demonstrates understanding of the basic meaning of a majority of the documents. Supports the thesis with appropriate interpretations of a majority of the documents. Analyzes point of view or bias in at least three documents. Analyzes the documents by explicitly grouping them in at least three appropriate ways.  You may refer to relevant historical information not mentioned in the documents. 1.Analyze changing conceptions of French national identity and culture in the period since 1960.Historical background: In the wake of the Second World War, France became increasingly integrated into the global economy. Beginning in the 1960s, France also experienced growing rates of immigration, mostly from former French colonies. Document 1 Source: Maurice Duverger, political analyst, newspaper interview, 1964. It must be said, it must be written. There is only one immediate danger for Europe, and that is American civilization. There will be no Stalinism or communism in France. They are scarecrows that frighten only sparrows now. . . . Today, all that belongs to the past. On the other hand, the pressure of American society, the domination of the American economy, the invasion of the American mentality—all that is very dangerous. . . . [But the French] cultural ensemble that is at the core of [our] attitudes is shaped by a completely different historical legacy. I think this element will help us resist pressure from America. Document 2 Source: Poster from the French Democratic Confederation of Labor, the largest trade union organization in France, 1970. The image is a poster from the French Democratic Confederation of Labor.  On the poster are the letters C. F. D. T. along with four arms holding one another. One hand and arm from each individual, of different racial groups, grasps another arm just below the wrist making the shape of a square.
In the lower left section of the poser are the French words, TRAVAILLEURS, FRANÇAIS IMMIGRÉS, TOUS SOLIDARES.
Translation: “French Workers and Immigrant Workers―All Together in Solidarity”

I ask myself: why should we accept this homogenization? Is this really mankind’s destiny? The same films, the same music, the same clothes? . . .We wish to proclaim a real cultural revolt, to embark on a crusade against—let us call it by its name—against the financial and intellectual imperialism  [of globalization]. Document 4 Source: Maurice Arreckx, mayor of the Mediterranean port city of Toulon, newspaper article, 1983. As an elected politician it is my duty to say out loud what everyone is thinking to themselves but does not dare to say. France has, and must preserve, a great tradition of welcome, but she does not have the obligation to be the refuge of the unemployed of Europe and Africa. Our country has become a dustbin where revolutionaries, delinquents and anarchists of every sort have collected. We must get rid of them. Document 5 Source: Image of Marianne, symbol of France, and a veiled woman, on the cover of Le Figaro Magazine, 1991. The image of Marianne, the symbol of France, and a woman in the background wearing traditional Islamic garments covering the head and the face is shown on the cover of a 1991 edition of the magazine, Le Figaro.

The information across the image reads in French: IMMIGRATION OU INVASION? VALERY GISCARD D’ESTAING ANALYSE NORTE SONDAGE-EVENEMENT

Translation: “Immigration or Invasion? Valéry Giscard d’Estaing analyzes the results of our opinion poll.”
Translation: “Immigration or Invasion? Valéry Giscard d’Estaing analyzes the results of our opinion poll.” Document 6 Source: Jacques Toubon, French Minister of Culture, interview with the Los Angeles Times, 1994. There are two objectives [of the new Toubon Law]. The first is an intrinsic one: to develop a way of guaranteeing that everything said and written in France can be understood by the entire French population. The Toubon Law will ensure that instruction manuals and explanatory leaflets for all products, whether domestic or imports, be translated into French. Contracts will be written in French so workers are able to understand them. And at scientific conferences, the French-speaking attendees will have to speak in French. Our second objective is broader—to develop French translations for words used in industries such as electronics and computers. Language is an irreplaceable capital for all peoples. If it is not preserved and modernized, it will no longer allow the people to express themselves, to understand each other, or to communicate with the universe. Document 7 Source: Jean d’Ormesson, a philosopher and member of the Académie française,*the institution responsible for producing the official dictionary of the French language interview following the passage of the Toubon Law, 1994. What will happen? You think we’ll stop saying  le parking or le weekend ? I don’t think so. I am for the preservation of culture, but not by decree. A language is alive. It develops completely autonomously. You can’t legislate it. . . . French was born [in the Middle Ages] because Latin was in decline. The idea that we can stop the development of the language now is a foolish one. The only way to help the French language is to make good films, good theater, good songs, and if possible, good books. Document 8 Source: Young teacher, interviewed as part of an anthropological study of the education of immigrant children in French schools, late 1990s. I believe with all my heart that a common culture is transmitted by the schools and by national education, and that is a good thing. . . . It is good because I am profoundly secular through my education, through the way I function as a citizen, and as a human being in our society. What I am saying is debatable, but I think that our society has arrived at a point where it seems that, in order for our standards for a common culture to harmonize, they must go through a  de-Christianization, a de-Islamization. . . . This de-culturation can lead to [the creation of] that common cement that binds us. Document 9 Source: José Bové, French farmer and food activist, The World Is Not For Sale, 2001. Nowadays, food is rarely eaten in anything like the state in which it leaves the farm. It is reconstructed—often several times over—to produce easily prepared, ready-made meals that can be consumed with little work in the home. The food industry regards the farmer as merely the supplier of raw commodities to meet the needs of the manufacturers, rather than those of the consumer. The art of French cooking and eating will soon not be passed on  to new generations; this has resulted in a loss of family cohesion and of the ties that bind us to the land or place where we live.  Document 10 Source: Tunisian immigrant mother, radio interview, 2002. I hate the term “beur.”*a term used to designate second- and third-generation immigrants from North Africa  I refuse to use it for my kids; I refuse “beur” because they speak the [French] language, because “beur” is not a language, it’s not a culture. Either they are French, or they are Tunisian, but they are not beurs. . . . Because the kids were born here, they are French. Document 11 Source: Zinedine Zidane, French national football team captain and World Cup winner, newspaper interview, 2004. It’s hard to explain but I have a need to play intensely every day, to fight every match hard. And this desire never to stop fighting is something else I learned in the place where I grew up. And, for me, the most important thing is that I still know who I am. Every day I think about where I come from and I am still proud to be who I am: first, a Kabyle*ethnic group from North Africa from La Castellane,**an ethnic neighborhood on the outskirts of Marseille, a city in southern France  then an Algerian from Marseille, and then a Frenchman. END OF PART A EUROPEAN HISTORY SECTION II Part B (Suggested planning and writing time—35 minutes) Percent of Section II score—27 1/2 Directions:  You are to answer ONE question from the three questions below.
