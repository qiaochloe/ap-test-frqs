Traditionally, knowledge had been based on faith and insight, on reason and revelation. The new science discarded all of these as ways of understanding nature and set up experience—experiment and critical observation—as the foundation and ultimate test of knowledge. The consequences were as revolutionary as the doctrine itself. For not only did the new method found knowledge on a wholly new basis, but it implied that men and women no longer had to believe what was said by eminent authorities; they could put any statement to the test of controlled experience.” I. Bernard Cohen, historian, Revolution in Science, 1985 1.	 a) Identify TWO specific examples of scientific discovery that support Cohen’s argument and explain how each one supports his argument. b) Explain ONE way in which the shift in scientific inquiry described by Cohen affected European views of society or politics in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Use the passages below to answer all parts of the question that follows. “When [the Dutch burgher] goes home from Church, does he take God’s Holy Book with him to ponder the sermon? No. Instead he picks up the day’s [business] gazette and busies himself with calculations of interest and the liquidation of debts. It would be better [if] on the Lord’s Day he gave some accounting of himself and, instead of reckoning his profits, reckoned up his sins.” Simonides, minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, Four Books on God’s Judgment, 1655 “So, Amsterdam has risen through the hand of God to the peak of prosperity and greatness.... The whole world stands amazed at its riches and from east and west, north and south they come to behold it. The Great and Almighty Lord has raised this city above all others...yeaHehaseventaken from them the [commerce] of the east and the west (for in former times Lisbon flourished) and has spilled their treasure into our bosom.” Melchior Fokkens, Dutch historian, Description of the Widely Renowned Merchant City of Amsterdam, 1662 2.	 a) Describe ONE important difference between the views of commerce and prosperity expressed in the two passages. b) For EACH of the passages, identify and explain ONE factor (such as a historical development, an intellectual or philosophical trend, or a religious belief) that likely informed the view of commerce and prosperity expressed in that passage. Answer all parts of the question that follows. 3. Many historians contend that the development of railroads in the early 1800s was a significant turning point in European history. a) Identify TWO specific pieces of evidence that support the contention, and explain how each piece supports the contention. b) Identify ONE specific piece of evidence that undermines the contention, and explain how it undermines the contention. Use the table below to answer all parts of the question that follows. PERCENT OF THE WORKFORCE PER ECONOMIC SECTOR IN FRANCE, 1800–2012 Year  Agriculture  Manufacturing (including construction)  Services 1800 64%  22% 14%  1900  43%  29% 28%  1950  32%  33% 35% 2012 3% 21% 76% Source: adapted from Thomas Piketty, Capital In the Twenty-ﬁrst Century, transl.

A development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area. A course theme and/or approach to history that is not the focus of the essay (such as political, economic, social, cultural, or intellectual history). A different discipline or field of inquiry (such as economics, government and politics, art history, or anthropology). 1. Evaluate whether the policies of Otto von Bismarck’s government represented traditional conservatism or a new kind of conservatism in nineteenth-century Europe. Document 1 Source: Legislation passed by Bismarck’s government, 1869–1878 Law Concerning the Equality of all Religions with Respect to Civil Rights and Citizenship of July 3, 1869: All restrictions on citizenship or civil rights based on differences in religious confession are abolished. The right to hold public office shall be independent of religious confession. School Inspection Law of March 11, 1872: The supervision of all public and private school and educational institutions is solely under the control of the state and not of any clergy. Law Concerning the Order of the Society of Jesus [The Jesuits] of July 4, 1872: The Order of the Society of Jesus and similar order-like Congregations, are banned hereby from the territory of the German Reich. The members of the Order of the Society of Jesus or similar order-like Congregations can be banished, if they are foreigners; if they are natives, their residence in certain districts or places can be denied, or they can be banished. Law Against the Publicly Dangerous Endeavors of Social Democracy from October 21, 1878: Societies which aim at the overthrow of the existing political or social order through social-democratic, socialist, or communist endeavors are to be prohibited. Public festivities and processions shall be treated the same as meetings. Publications in which social-democratic, socialist, or communist endeavors aimed at the overthrow of the existing political or social order are manifested in a manner calculated to endanger the harmony among all classes of the population are to be prohibited. Document 2 Source: Wilhelm Liebknecht, German socialist, political speech, 1869 Is it the duty of the Socialists to send delegates to the Reichstag [German parliament] at all? Our Social-Democratic Party (SPD)* must not, under any circumstances, or in any field, engage in transactions with its opponents. We can only transact business where there is a common basis. To do business with those who are your opponents in principle is equivalent to a sacrifice of principle.... The slightest concession in matters of principle is a relinquishing of the principle entirely. He who parliamentarizes, compromises. Suppose a candidate comes up for election and the government is absolutely opposed to having him in the Reichstag. The government will confiscate the newspapers that advocate his election—it will do so legally; it will confiscate his election handbills—also legally; or it will give permits for meetings of electors and then dissolve them—again legally; it will arrest the candidate’s campaign managers—quite legally; it will arrest the candidate himself—also legally. They recently arrested a delegate to the Reichstag, and that delegate would still be in prison right now if the National Liberals** had not been convinced by Bismarck of his harmlessness. There is no possibility of our having an influence on legislation. Tell me, in heaven’s name, what would be the use of a presentation of our principles in the Reichstag? Do you think you would convert the members of the Reichstag? The idea is more than childish; it is infantile. *the largest socialist party in Germany **one of the main parties supporting Bismarck’s government at the time Document 3 Source: Hermann Wagener, high public official and conservative politician, memorandum written for Otto von Bismarck, “Why the Government Cannot Ignore the Social Question: A Conservative View,” 1872 It is extremely dangerous to take up the battle against the ultramontane [extremely Catholic] and socialist parties simultaneously. It is important to keep those pursuing anti-national aims away from the social movement but it would be a political mistake to subject socialist leaders to emergency laws on account of their social advocacy, particularly without also doing something substantial to satisfy the just efforts of their followers. It would be hopeless to fight a powerful idea merely with material means, and, with respect to the extremely powerful Catholic-clerical idea, there is currently only one idea that can be used as a political counterweight with any prospect of success—and that is the social idea. The “social Kaiser” has a stronger position than even the “social Pope.” At the moment, the mass of the population is wavering, unsure of the direction in which to turn. So far, the international agitation has not gained a broader basis; where the masses turn, however, will be of crucial significance not just for politics but also for the character of the army. The army will only be completely reliable if the workers, who make up its main contingent, are won over and bound to the idea of the Reich through its very benefits and performance. Document 4 Source: “At the helm,” political cartoon portraying Bismarck, published in a satirical German magazine, 1879 The cartoon portrays Bismarck standing on the deck of a ship and holding the ship’s steering wheel while looking off into the distance during a storm at sea. The ship’s wheel has 3 handles aligned with spokes on the wheel that represent people and are labeled from the top moving clockwise, Conservative, Liberal, and Ultramontane. Bismarck is holding on to the Conservative handle at the top of the wheel and has a hand on the lower Ultramontane handle. The Liberal handle is at the lowest position on the wheel.bpk, Berlin / Dietmar Katz / Art Resource, NY Caption: The Liberal says to the other two: “Don’t worry; when the wind shifts, I’ll be on top again.” Document 5 Source: Kaiser Wilhelm I’s speech opening the Reichstag, Berlin, November 1881 We, Wilhelm, German Emperor by the Grace of God, King of Prussia announce that in February of this year, We let Our conviction be known that curing social defects will be pursued not only through the repression of Social Democratic excesses but also through the promotion of workers’ welfare. We deem it Our Imperial Duty to urge the Reichstag to take this task to heart once again. We would look back with all the more satisfaction on the many successes with which God has blessed Our government [and] We could be content having left the fatherland lasting guarantees of internal peace and having given the needy greater security and the assistance to which they are entitled. We trust that we have the support of the Reichstag, despite party differences. The draft bill submitted during the last session on insuring workers against industrial accidents will be revised. Another bill will be added; the additional bill will give consistent organization to the commercial health insurance system. [It should not be forgotten], however, that all those persons who have become unfit for gainful employment through age or disability also have a legitimate claim to a greater degree of state welfare than they have received thus far. Finding the proper ways and means to ensure this level of welfare is difficult, but it is also one of the highest tasks of any community that rests upon the moral foundation of a Christian national life. Document 6 Source: Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, speech in support of the new accident insurance bill, Berlin, March 5, 1884 Government according to Frederick the Great is to serve the people; the opposite is to dominate the people. We want to serve the people. It is not correct that we made the proposal to win more support for the Anti-Socialist law. At the time of the proposal of the law, His Majesty the Emperor and the majority of the Reichstag promised that as a corollary to this law there would also be a serious effort to better conditions for the workers. The whole problem is rooted in the question: does the state have the responsibility to care for its helpless fellow citizens, or does it not? I maintain that it does have this duty and not simply the Christian state but indeed every state. There are objectives that only the state can fulfill including national defense and the general system of transportation. But the state must help persons in distress and prevent the workers’ complaints that can be exploited by the Social Democrats. If one argues against my position that this is socialism, then I do not fear that at all. The question is what are the limits of state socialism? Each law for poor relief is socialism. There are states that distance themselves so far from socialism that poor laws do not exist at all. These states take the French view that every French citizen has the right to starve and that the state has no responsibility to hinder him in the exercise of his right. Document 7 Source: Eugen Richter, liberal journalist and politician, newspaper article, 1890 The dismissal of Reich Chancellor Prince Bismarck is an accomplished fact. Thank God he’s gone! A continuation of the domestic policy pursued up to now would actually have brought Germany to ruin, had it been followed by another such period. The fact that in the last elections one-fifth of the German people declared their support for the Social Democratic Party is mainly the fault of the Bismarckian system of government; it boosted socialism artificially by offering the carrot one moment and applying the stick the next. Existing religious differences were exacerbated through the battle over church policy, carried out by way of the police and criminal regulations. The incitement of the parties against each other, the suspicions cast upon people’s patriotism, and the denial of patriotism to any political dissident resulted from a press corrupted by bribery and fear. Before the eyes of the world, what he did to unify the Fatherland was shown to the fullest advantage; but later generations, those destined to suffer the consequences of his flawed domestic policies, will become fully aware of how these measures have sinned against national life. We must once again draw inspiration from the idea that the people themselves are called upon to participate in their own destiny. In the long term, people get only the kind of government they deserve. END OF DOCUMENTS FOR QUESTION 1
