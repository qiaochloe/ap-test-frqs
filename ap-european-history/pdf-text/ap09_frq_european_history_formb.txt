Analyze the causes of and responses to the 1968 crisis in France.   Historical Background: By 1968 President Charles de Gaulle and his conservative supporters had controlled the French government for ten years. In May 1968 workers and students took to the streets of Paris in an unprecedented wave of strikes, walkouts, and demonstrations that spread to more than 50 towns throughout France. By May 18, students had seized university buildings nationwide and 10 million French workers had gone on strike. © 2009 The College Board. All rights reserved.

These pseudo-revolutionary groups are now presuming to give lessons to the labor movement. These false revolutionaries must  be energetically unmasked, because in actual fact they are serving the interests of the  Gaullist regime. They are damaging our party and attempting to question the primacy  of the working class in the struggle for progress, democracy, and socialism. The French Communist Party is the best defender of the immediate demands of manual and intellectual workers. © 2009 The College Board. All rights reserved.

First of all, the causes reside in the values of the entire society. They also come from within the university—the overflow of students, the anxiety they feel about their future, and the insufficient adaptation of teaching to their lives. Document 4 Source: Workers’ solidarity pamphlet #39, date unknown. In the late sixties in France, real wages are on the rise, but large sections of the working class are still suffering from low pay. This is despite foreign trade having tripled. Twenty-five percent of all workers are receiving less than 500 francs [equivalent to $100] per month. Some unskilled workers are getting only 400 francs per month. Unemployment is at half a million, in a period which is considered a postwar boom. Trade union membership has dropped to about three million, as opposed to seven million in 1945. Not many victories have been won in the preceding years. The Michelin Tire Company boasts that it has only talked to trade unions three times in 30 years. © 2009 The College Board. All rights reserved.

The fighting was bitter. The students were armed, if at all, with lids of garbage pails, while the burly riot police facing them were equipped with enormous shields of medieval size and were wearing modern anti-tear-gas goggles. Whether from the students’ amateur Molotov cocktails or from police tear gas canisters, all the captive automobiles that the students used as barricades were set aflame. Document 7 Source: Student slogans shouted in street demonstrations, May 1968. PROFESSORS, YOU AND YOUR CULTURE ARE OUTDATED. WE REFUSE TO BE THE FUTURE CADRE OF CAPITALIST EXPLOITERS. DE GAULLE, ASSASSIN! DE GAULLE, RESIGNATION! Document 8 Source: Edgar Morin, sociologist, in the politically moderate newspaper Le Monde, May 22, 1968. The working class responded to the students’ passionate call to revolt. The issue of student-worker fraternization is an important aspect of a struggle to the death between two ideologies. First, the rejuvenated extreme leftist movements are thirsting for revenge against the Communists. Second, the reformism practiced by the Communist Party corresponds to the material needs of a large section of the working class, but not to the young workers. Are “worker control” and “revolution” the cure-alls that will destroy a system based on factory regimentation? © 2009 The College Board. All rights reserved.

It’s a much larger problem than Gaullism—or even France. The industrial world is confronted by the rapid acceleration of intellectual change. Such acceleration directly conflicts with the rigidity of traditional structures. And when this conflict occurs, the structures are the first to crumble. The Revolution came to France first because French structures are more rigid. Gaullism has rigidified the nation of France. There was no dialogue between unions and industry, between industry and executive powers. Everything was frozen by the intellectual dictatorship of de Gaulle. I am encouraged by the fact that France has exploded. *Term used for Charles de Gaulle’s strong, centralized presidential rule © 2009 The College Board.

The totalitarian Communists are waiting to ride to power on France’s despair. The republic will not abdicate! The people will collect themselves. Progress, independence, and peace will prevail along with liberty. Vive la France! [Long live France!] Document 12 Source: President de Gaulle, interview on French national television following the Gaullist election victory, June 11, 1968. Two things made up the recent university crisis. First, there was the anguish of youth, of the students, which is infinitely natural in today’s modern, mechanized consumer society, because it does not offer them what they need—an ideal, an élan, a hope. Then an explosion took place in the university milieu. It was provoked by certain groups that were in revolt against this modern society, whether communist in the East or capitalist in the West. These groups have no idea at all what they would replace modern society with, but they are groups that delight in negation, destruction, violence, and anarchy, and they fly the anarchists’ black flag. END OF PART A © 2009 The College Board.
