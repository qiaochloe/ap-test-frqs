The Russian people were trapped by the tyranny of their own history....For while the people could destroy the old system, they could not build a new one of their own....By 1921, if not earlier, the revolution had come full circle, and a new autocracy had been imposed on Russia which in many ways resembled the old.” Orlando Figes, historian, A People’s Tragedy: The Russian Revolution, 1891-1924, published in 1997 1.a) Describe one piece of evidence that would support the author’s characterization of Russia’s political cultureprior to the Bolshevik Revolution.b)Describe one piece of evidence that would support the author’s interpretation of Russia’s “new autocracy” inthe 1920s and 1930s.c)Describe one piece of evidence that would undermine the author’s argument in the passage that the “newautocracy” in Russia resembled the old.Use the image below to answer all parts of the question that follows. Louis-Simon Boizot, Liberty Armed with the Scepter of Reason Striking down Ignorance and Fanaticism, France, 1793 The figure presents an engraving titled “Liberty Armed with the Scepter of Reason Striking down Ignorance and Fanaticism.” In the engraving, a woman representing liberty is shown seated, holding up a scepter in the direction of two women representing ignorance and fanaticism. Energy is shown emanating from the scepter in the form of arrows. One of the women is standing and holding up a cloth attempting to block the energy from the scepter. The other woman has fallen to the ground, and her eyes are covered with cloth. Another woman is standing to the right of the seated woman. She has her hand on the shoulder of the seated woman and is holding a leash that is on a lion. The lion is lying on the ground. Liberty armed with the sceptre of reason striking down Ignorance and Fanaticism, 1793 (engraving) (b/w photo), Boizot, Simon Louis (1743-1809) (after) / Musee de la Ville de Paris, Musee Carnavalet, Paris, France / Bridgeman Images 2. a) Describe one way in which the image expresses ideas popularized during the Enlightenment. b) Describe one way in which the image reflects the policies of the French Revolutionary government’s radical phase. c) Describe one way in which the ideas in the image continued to influence European political thought after 1815. Question 3 or 4 Directions: Answer either Question 3 or Question 4. Answer (a), (b), and (c). 3. a) Describe one cause of the Protestant Reformation in England during the reign of Henry VIII (1509–1547). b) Describe one political effect of the Protestant Reformation in England in the period 1500–1600. c) Explain one difference between political effects of the Protestant Reformation in England and political effects of the Protestant Reformation in France in the period 1500–1600. Answer (a), (b), and (c). 4. a) Describe one cause of Great Britain’s early industrialization in the period 1700–1800. b) Describe one effect of Great Britain’s industrialization on the European balance of power in the period 1800–1900. c) Explain one political reaction to industrialization within Great Britain in the period 1800–1900. END OF SECTION I EUROPEAN HISTORY SECTION II Total Time—1 hour and 40 minutes Question 1 (Document-Based Question) Suggested reading and writing time: 1 hour It is suggested that you spend 15 minutes reading the documents and 45 minutes writing your response.

The documents have been edited for the purpose of this exercise. In your response you should do the following. Respond to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning. Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. Support an argument in response to the prompt using at least six documents. Use at least one additional piece of specific historical evidence (beyond that found in the documents) relevant to an argument about the prompt. For at least three documents, explain how or why the document’s point of view, purpose, historical situation, and/or audience is relevant to an argument. Use evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the prompt. 1. Evaluate whether or not the Catholic Church in the 1600s was opposed to new ideas in science. Document 1 Source: Paolo Antonio Foscarini, Catholic monk and scientist, excerpt from An Epistle Concerning the Pythagorean and Copernican Opinion of the Mobility of the Earth and Stability of the Sun, 1615 Because the common system of the world devised by Ptolemy has hitherto satisfied none of the learned, hereupon a suspicion is risen up amongst all, even Ptolemy’s followers themselves, that there must be some other system which is more true than this of Ptolemy.... The telescope (an optick invention) has been found out, by help of which many remarkable things in the heavens... were discovered....By this same instrument it appears very probable that Venus and Mercury do not move properly about the Earth, but rather about the sun; and that the Moon alone moveth about the Earth... Now there is no better or more convenient hypothesis than that of Copernicus. Because of this, many modern authors are induced to approve of, and follow it: but with much hesitancy and fear, because it seems to contradict the Holy Scriptures, and it cannot possibly be reconciled to them. Which is the reason why this hypothesis has been long suppressed and is now entertained by men in a modest manner, and as it were with a veiled face. Document 2 Source: Catholic Cardinal Bellarmine, letter of response to Paolo Antonio Foscarini, 1615 I have read with interest your letter; I thank you for this and confess that it is full of intelligence and erudition. You ask for my opinion, and so I shall give it to you, but very briefly, since now you have little time for reading and I for writing. First,...towanttoaffirm that in reality the sun is at the center of the world and only turns on itself without moving from east to west, and the earth...revolves with great speed around the sun...isavery dangerous thing, likely not only to irritate all scholastic philosophers and theologians, but also to harm the Holy Faith by rendering Holy Scripture false. Second, I say that, as you know, the Council [of Trent] prohibits interpreting Scripture against the common consensus of the Holy Fathers.... Third, I say that if it were clearly demonstrated that the sun is at the center of the universe and the earth in the third orbit, and that the sun does not circle the earth but the earth circles the sun, then one would have to proceed with great care in explaining the Scriptures that appear contrary, and say rather that we do not understand those passages of Scripture, rather than say that what is demonstrated is false. But I will not believe that there is such a demonstration, until it is shown to me. Document 3 Source: Christoph Grienberger, German Jesuit mathematics professor in Rome, 1615 A new description of the universe seems to be necessary because the old one has been changed a great deal in our day and many embellishments have been added to it. But the question has been raised as to whether it is proper for us Jesuits to do this. It seems to me that the time has now come for a greater degree of freedom of thought to be given to both mathematicians and philosophers on this matter [the constitution of the heavens], for the imperfection of the heavens is not absolutely contrary to theology or to philosophy and even much less to mathematics....It seems that our colleague Biancani has not exercised his talents sufficiently in writing the Cosmographia [which rejected heliocentrism and the existence of mountains on the moon]. But I am quite willing to excuse him about this. For up to now his hands have been tied, as have ours. Thus he has dealt with most topics in a way which is not adequate when he was not allowed to think freely about what is required. Document 4 Source: Galileo Galilei, Italian mathematician, astronomer, and physicist, letter to the Grand Duchess Christina of Tuscany, 1615 The reason produced for condemning the opinion that the earth moves and the sun stands still is that in many places in the Bible one may read that the sun moves and the earth stands still. Since the Bible cannot err, it follows as necessary the consequence that anyone takes an erroneous and heretical position who maintains that the sun is inherently motionless and the earth movable. With regard to this argument, I think in the first place that it is very pious to say and prudent to affirm that the holy Bible can never speak untruth—whenever its true meaning is understood. But I believe nobody will deny that it is often very abstruse, and may say things which are quite different from what its bare words signify. Hence in expounding the Bible if one were always to confine oneself to the unadorned grammatical meaning, one might fall into error.... I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with senses, reason, and intellect has intended to forgo their use by some other means to give us knowledge which we can attain by them. He would not require us to deny sense and reason in physical matters which are set before our eyes and minds by direct experience or necessary demonstrations. Document 5 Source: Maria Celeste Galilei, Catholic nun, letter to her father, Galileo, 1623 The happiness I derived from the gift of letters you sent me, Sire, written to you by that most distinguished Cardinal, now elevated to the exalted position of Pope, was indescribable, for his letters so clearly express the affection this great man has for you, and also show how highly he values your abilities. I have read and reread them, savoring them in private, and I return them to you, as you insist, without having shown them to anyone else except Suor Arcangela,* who has joined me in drawing the utmost joy from seeing how much our father is favored by persons of such caliber. *a fellow Catholic nun known for her radical political and philosophical beliefs Document 6 Source: Illustration from a text on sunspots by Christoph Scheiner, German Jesuit astronomer, 1630 The figure presents an illustration. In the illustration, a man is shown seated at a desk in a room with many windows. He appears to be working on an astronomical drawing. He is pointing toward another man who is kneeling on the ground, working with a machine that resembles a telescope. Light is shown entering the end of the telescope that is near a window. The light is escaping from the other end of the telescope and projecting on a square surface that has an astronomical drawing on it. Latin text is written at the bottom of the illustration. Private Collection/Bridgeman Images Document 7 Source: Critique of French thinker René Descartes by the Jesuits of Clermont College, Paris, 1665 Descartes’ thoughts on scientific reasoning are distasteful to mathematics, philosophy, and theology. They are distasteful to philosophy, because they overthrow all philosophical principles and ideas which common sense has accepted for centuries. They are distasteful to mathematics, because mathematics cannot be used to explain natural things without great disturbance of the traditional order. They are distasteful to theology, because Descartes’ reasoning attributes too much to the chance combination of atoms, which favors the atheist. And finally, following Descartes’ reasoning, there can be no conversion of bread and wine in the Eucharist into the blood and body of Christ, which favors heretics. END OF DOCUMENTS FOR QUESTION 1 Question 2, 3, or 4 (Long Essay) Suggested writing time: 40 minutes Directions: Answer Question 2 or Question 3 or Question 4. In your response you should do the following. Respond to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning.Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt.Support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant examples of evidence.Use historical reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, continuity or change over time) to frame or structure anargument that addresses the prompt. Use evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the prompt.2.Evaluate the most significant effect of state centralization by European monarchs during the period 1450–1648.3.Evaluate the most significant effect of population growth in Europe within the period 1700–1800.4.Evaluate the most significant effect of the Great Depression in Europe during the period 1929–1950.WHEN YOU FINISH WRITING, CHECK YOUR WORK ON SECTION II IF TIME PERMITS. STOP END OF EXAM
