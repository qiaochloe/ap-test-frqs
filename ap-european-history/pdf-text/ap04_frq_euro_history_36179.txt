Analyze the concerns and goals of participants in the Pilgrimage of Grace and of those who opposed the movement.   Historical Background: In 1534, the Act of Supremacy made Henry VIII head of the Anglican Church, marking the beginning of the Protestant Reformation in England. Thomas Cromwell, Henry VIII’s Lord High Chancellor and head of the King’s Council, subsequently implemented a series of governmental policies including new taxes, the expansion of royal power in the north of England, the dissolution of monasteries, and the confiscation of Catholic church lands. In reaction to these measures, marchers staged protests and armed demonstrations known collectively as the Pilgrimage of Grace from October 1536 to February 1537. Copyright © 2004 by College Entrance Examination Board.

Do so only for your love of God, for the Holy Catholic Church militant, for the preservation of the King and his heirs, for the purification of the nobility, and to expel all evil counselors. Take before you the Cross of Christ, and in your hearts His faith. Document 2 Source:  Marchers’ Proclamation, delivered at several gatherings in northern England, October 1536. Because the rulers of this country do not defend us from being robbed by thieves and Scots, we have to rely on charity, faith, poverty and pity. We must be ready to help one another when thieves or Scots would rob or invade us either by night or day. Copyright © 2004 by College Entrance Examination Board. All rights reserved.

Robbed, spoiled and shorn Of cattle and corn, Houses and lands. Document 5 Source:  Selected articles from a petition presented to members of the King’s Council, written by Robert Aske, gentleman, Pontefract Castle, December 1536. We humbly beseech our most Sovereign King: To have the heresies of Luther, Wycliffe, Hus, and Tyndale annulled and destroyed. To have the supreme head of the Church be the pope in Rome as before. To have the monasteries’ houses, lands and goods restored to them. To have the heretics consigned to punishment by fire. To have Thomas Cromwell, the Lord Chancellor, punished as a subverter of the good  laws of this realm. To restore tenant rights by an act of Parliament. To repeal statutes against handguns and crossbows. To pull down all recent enclosures. To have Parliament convene in York or some other nearby place as in the past. To repeal the statute for treason for the spoken word alone. Copyright © 2004 by College Entrance Examination Board. All rights reserved.

It is little more than a council of the King’s appointees. Counties and towns ought to elect knights and burgesses who would speak on their behalf. Instead we have a Parliament where men may not speak of the King’s vices but only say what Cromwell says is right. Document 7 Source:  Richard Morrison, writer hired by Thomas Cromwell, “A Remedy for Sedition,” pamphlet, published by the Royal printer, December 1536. When every man rules, who shall obey? Those that are of the worser sort must be content that the wiser rule and govern them. An order must be had and a way found so that the better rule the rest. This arrangement is not only expedient, but also most necessary in a commonwealth. Document 8 Source:  Nicholas Leche, Catholic parish priest, testimony given while imprisoned in the Tower of London 1536. During the whole insurrection, not one gentleman tried to warn the commoners of Lincoln  that it was treason. The gentlemen could have stopped the rebellion then, but did not, never believing their actions to be offensive to the King. In fact, they had waged the rebellion against the Privy Council in the name of the King. Copyright © 2004 by College Entrance Examination Board. All rights reserved.

You have given comfort to your enemies the Scots, to the high displeasure of God who commands you to obey your sovereign in all things. Nevertheless, the royal majesty, duly informed that your offenses proceeded from ignorance and false tales, is inclined to extend his most gracious pity and mercy towards you and to grant to you his free pardon provided that you heartily repent your offenses and make humble submission to his highness. Document 10 Source:  Statistics collected from court records, Letters and Papers of Henry VIII. Results of the First Treason Trials of Participants in the  Pilgrimage of Grace, January to March 1537 Status of Number Number Percentage Accused Tried Convicted Convicted Gentlemen 21 14 67% Clergy 25 20 80%  Commoners 177 110 62% Total 223  144  65% Document 11 Source:  Robert Aske, gentleman, Lincoln, testimony given shortly before his execution, April 1537. Once the monasteries in the north gave great help to poor men and laudable service to God. Now no hospitality is shown to travelers. Instead, farmers rent out farms and taverns for  profit. Any monies earned from abbey lands are now going to the King. Also, many tenants who were fed and aided by abbeys now can barely live. Traveling strangers and beggars have no help on the roads. Sea walls, dikes, bridges and high walls that were once maintained by the monasteries for the good of the Commonwealth are now left untended. END OF PART A Copyright © 2004 by College Entrance Examination Board.
