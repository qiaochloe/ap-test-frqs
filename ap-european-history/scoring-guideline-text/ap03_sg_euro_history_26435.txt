Has an acceptable thesis. Thesis must be explicit, respond to the question, and be based on one or more documents.  It may not be a simple rewording of the question or of the historical background. Thesis need not appear in the first paragraph. 2. Uses a majority of documents. Uses at least 7 documents by reference to anything in the box, even if used incorrectly. They need not be cited by number or name. 3. Supports thesis or answers question with appropriate evidence from at least one document. Even when there is no thesis, the essay can still offer evidence from the documents relating to the concept of civil peace, earning a point. 4. Understands the basic meaning of the documents cited in the essay. Must use at least four documents correctly.  May make a major misinterpretation ofno more than one document; a major misinterpretation is one that leads to an inaccurate grouping or a false analysis.   Two “almost major errors” = one major error.  Errors in attempts to use POV should not be judged as severely. 5. Analyzes bias or point of view in at leasttwo documents. Relates authorial point of view to author’s place (position, status, etc.) OR Evaluates the reliability of the source OR Recognizes that different kinds of documents serve different purposes OR Analyzes tone or intent of documents – several weak attempts of this sort equal one solid POV OR analyzes POV or bias in one document well and gives consistent attribution. 6. Analyzes documents by grouping them in at least two groups. A group must have at least 2 docs. A fallacious grouping receives no credit. Examples of possible groups: Pro and anti civil peace: pro(1,2,3,4,6,11) anti(5,7,8,9,10,12) Earlier, middle and later documents: earlier (1,2,3,4,5) middle (6,7,8, 9) later (10,11,12) Official and civilian sources: official (1,2,9,10,11) civilian (3,4,5,6,7,8,12) Male and female subjects and sources: male (1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,11,12), female (4,8,9) Military sources: (1,7,9,11) Progressives: (3,4,5,7, 12) EXPANDED CORE: [0-3 points to a total of 9 points] Must earn 6 points in the basic core before earning points in the expanded core.
