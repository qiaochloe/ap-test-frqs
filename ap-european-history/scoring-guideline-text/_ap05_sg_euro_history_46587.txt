Has an acceptable thesis. The thesis must be explicit, responsive to the charge, and based on one or more documents. It may not be a simple rewording of the question or a simplistic enumeration of groups. The thesis must suggest a minimal level of analysis or context. It need not appear in the first paragraph; it may be elsewhere in the essay. 2. Uses a majority of documents. Students must use at least seven documents by reference to anything in the box, even if used incorrectly. They need not be cited by number or name. Asterisked material is to be treated as historical background. 3. Addresses all parts of the question. Students must discuss more than one type of opinion (view) and draw from early (1–7) and late (8–12) documents. 4. Understands the basic meaning of the documents cited in the essay. Students must not significantly misinterpret more than one document; a major misinterpretation is an incorrect analysis or one that leads to an inaccurate grouping or a false conclusion. Errors in attempts to provide point of view or in use of outside information should be judged less severely. One major error plus any minor error means loss of this point. 5. Analyzes bias or point of view in at least three documents. • Relates authorial point of view to author’s place (motive, position, status, etc.) OR • Evaluates the reliability of the source OR • Recognizes that different kinds of documents serve different purposes OR • Analyzes tone of documents; counts as a weak point of view unless well developed. • Point of view can be achieved collectively through analysis of motives of a group or explanations of reasons for group’s attitudes; counts as one point of view. • Any three weak attempts at point of view equal one point of view. Question 1—Document-Based Question (continued) 6. Analyzes documents by grouping them in at least three groups. A group must have at least two documents. A fallacious grouping receives no credit. Examples of possible groups (not exhaustive): Political concerns All Economic concerns 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 Social/moral/cultural 1, 6, 9, 12 Military   10, 11 Cold War   3, 4, 10, 11 Early   1–7 (1940s, 1950s) Middle   8, 9 (1960s, 1970s) Late    10, 11, 12 (1980s) Peace   1, 5, 6, 9 Revival of Europe 1, 9 Pro     1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 Anti    3, 4 Ambivalent   2, 7, 8, 12 UK authors    1, 2, 7, 12 About UK 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 12 French authors   5, 8 About France 1, 2, 3, 5 German authors   6, 9 About Germany 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 USSR    3, 4 Small states   10, 11 About U.S. 1, 2, 3, 4 EXPANDED CORE: 0–3 points to a total of 9 points Students must earn all 6 points in the basic core before earning points in the expanded core. A student earns points to the degree to which he or she does one or more of the following: • Has a clear, analytical, and comprehensive thesis. • Uses all or almost all documents (using 10 or more documents is not unusual for this question). • Uses documents persuasively as evidence. • Shows careful and insightful analysis of the documents. • Analyzes bias or point of view in at least 4 documents cited in the essay. • Analyzes the documents in additional ways; e.g., has additional groupings or other forms of analysis, accurately discusses change over time. • Brings in relevant “outside” historical content. Question 1 Document Summary Historical Background: Provided by a map showing the six original members (France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, without specifically identifying the organization), with England, Denmark, and Ireland joining in 1973, Spain, Portugal, and Greece in the early 1980s.  Document 1: Sir Winston Churchill, former British Prime Minister, speech, University of Zurich, September 1946.  Churchill advocates a United States of Europe. France must lead in forming a partnership with Germany as the first step in re-creation of the European family and restoration of their spiritual greatness. Small nations will be as important as large ones. The first step would be a Council of Europe. Document 2: Duncan Sandys, leader of British European Movement, report to Churchill on a conversation with Charles de Gaulle, November 1946. Churchill’s speech is badly received in France. The French are violently opposed to re-creating united, centralized German state and are gravely suspicious of American and British policy in Germany. Britain must be founding partner with France to avoid revival of German power. Document 3: Andrei Vyshinsky, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister, speech to United Nations General Assembly, September 1947. Marshall Plan puts European countries under U.S. economic and political control. Plan is meant to split Europe and to make Western bloc hostile to interests of “democratic” countries of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, a policy incompatible with U.N. principles.  Document 4: Soviet political cartoon of West German Finance Minister, Ludwig Erhard, Moscow, November 1949. “How America’s Big Stick Solves the Problem of the Market.” Germany uses America’s economic power (or America uses Germany) to destroy sovereignty of Western European countries and tariff barriers. Document 5: Robert Schuman, French Minister of Foreign Affairs, public announcement, May 1950. Schuman announces plan to establish common market in coal and steel and invites Germany to join as the basis for further joint action. Eliminating the age-old French–German opposition will establish a peaceful, united, and solidly built Europe. Document 6: Konrad Adenauer, West German Chancellor, “The End of Nationalism” from his book A World Indivisible, New York, 1955. The two world wars have taught nations that they can no longer live exclusively for themselves and must merge their interests. The age of national states has come to an end. This will make a more peaceful world for the next generation. Document 7: Harold Macmillan, British Finance Minister, press statement, October 1956. UK might stay out of EEC, which would lose advantages for exports to European markets. Or UK might join EEC, which would destroy current system favoring trade within British Commonwealth. Can Britain have it both ways? Question 1 Document Summary (continued) Document 8: Charles de Gaulle, President of France, press conference, May 1967. Britain had different motives than The Six—overseas commitments and special relationship with the U.S. —and did not join the EEC, which it saw as a political and economic threat. If Britain is to join the EEC, it must be subject to its agricultural rules, which were a main factor for France’s participation. Document 9: Willy Brandt, Chancellor of West Germany, speech at Harvard, June 1972. Marshall Plan and European Coal and Steel Community were concrete stimuli to Europe’s renaissance. Progressive thinkers in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Britain, and Germany were ready to bring about a united Europe in lasting peace. Document 10: Jack Lynch, Prime Minister of Irish Parliament, speech, parliamentary debate, December 1980. Ireland has no traditional policy of neutrality. As a member of EEC, Ireland must be concerned for defense of territories of the community. Document 11: Felipe González, Prime Minister of Spain, press statement, January 1983. Joining NATO and the EEC are both necessary to consolidate democracy and end Spain’s traditional isolation. Document 12: Margaret Thatcher, British Prime Minister, speech on Single European Act, Bruges, Belgium, September 1988. To suppress nationhood and concentrate power at the center of a European union would be highly damaging. There is no standardized European personality. Europe should be united but in ways that preserve different traditions, parliamentary powers, and national pride of member nations. Question 1 Background Information IMPORTANT DATES IN THE CHRONOLOGY OF EUROPEAN UNION 1945 End of World War II; Germany and Austria occupied by four Allied powers. 1946 Churchill’s “Iron Curtain” Speech. 1947 Truman Doctrine enunciated. Marshall Plan announced. 1948 Representatives from parliaments of 10 countries met in Strasbourg to establish Council of Europe. Benelux created—customs unions of Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg. 1949 Federal Republic of Germany established; Adenauer first Chancellor; introduction of new German currency. NATO established (with France, West Germany, Britain among the members). 1950 Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman call for steel and coal community. 1952 The Six establish the Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). 1957 Treaty of Rome: formation of European Economic Community (Common Market) by the six members of the ECSC. 1960 Britain helps create European Free Trade Association with Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, and Portugal. 1963 Britain applies for membership in the EEC, twice vetoed by De Gaulle. 1966 De Gaulle pulls France out of NATO military command. 1967 European Community formed. 1968 Last internal tariff in Common Market canceled; common agricultural policies agreed upon. De Gaulle vetoes the planned advent of majority rule in the EEC; later that year leaves Presidency of France and dies the next. 1973 Britain, Denmark, and Ireland join EEC, now 9 members.  Britain opposes agricultural subsidies to France and Italy as consuming too much of EC budget and keeping prices high. Government leaders begin meeting on a regular basis; rotating presidency established. 1979 European parliament elected by a Europe-wide electorate. 1981 Greece joins EC. 1986 Spain and Portugal join EC, now 12 members. 1987 Single European Act, agreement of 12 members to create a single Europe with free flow of goods and people. NOTE: The following dates refer to events outside the specified time period of the Document-Based Question and are included for reference only. 1991 Maastricht (Treaty of European Union). 1990s Expansion of EC to former Eastern European satellite states. 2001 Euro introduced. 2005 Voters in France and the Netherlands reject European Constitution. Question 2 Analyze how economic and social developments affected women in England in the period from 1700 to 1850.  9–6: Stronger • Has a clear, well-developed thesis. • Is well organized. • Addresses the terms of the question. • Supports the thesis with specific evidence. • May contain minor errors; even a 9 need not be flawless. Indicators • Fully engages with the tasks of the question, identifying social and economic changes AND their effects on women in England. • Explicitly links social and economic developments to changes in the lives of women. • Developments may be described in general terms (Agricultural Revolution, Factory Revolution, Industrial Revolution, etc.). • Examples are drawn primarily from the time period.  5–4: Mixed • Contains a thesis, perhaps superficial or simplistic. • Uneven response to the question’s terms. • May contain errors, factual or interpretive. Indicators • Addresses the tasks of the question, perhaps in general terms. • May conflate social and economic developments and the effects of those developments on women. • May be generalized with some pertinent detail. • May contain errors of chronology in the developments that affected women’s lives, such as political activism, political rights, white-collar occupations, World War I. 3–0: Weaker (Essays scored 1 or 0 may attempt to address the question but fail to do so.) • Thesis is confused, absent, or merely restates the question.  • Misconstrues the question or omits major tasks. • May contain major errors. Indicators • Makes an attempt to address the question with broad generalizations about developments and effects. • Is largely descriptive rather than analytical.  • May rely on stereotypes. • May lack historical context or rely on events and examples from outside the period. Question 2 Historical Background ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS that may be cited as having an effect on English women, 1700–1850.  Agricultural Revolution era developments: Agricultural Revolution was at the base of the Industrial Revolution. Innovations led to more productive agriculture, resulting in fewer workers needed for production. Market economy led to greater variety in food, higher demand, and healthier population. Enclosure effects in England: riots; did not force all small farmers off the land; did not create the labor force for the Industrial Revolution; “did bring entrepreneurial or capitalistic attitude of the urban merchant into the countryside” (Palmer); did make landlords more sensitive to profits, which left peasants to the mercy of the marketplace. Population growth (50 percent between 1730 and 1800) attributed to stable and better food supply (not hygiene or medical innovations, which fall outside of the question’s time period). Pre- or Protoindustrialization in England: Cottage industry, domestic system, putting-out system, etc. Colonial empire and foreign trade in the Americas and Europe. Highest standard of living in Europe; therefore, strong consumer demand for manufactured goods. Invention of machines and methods for improved coal mining, iron casting. Most manufacturing jobs took place in the home (domestic manufacturing, putting-out system, or domestic system) and included men, women, and children, and may have “comprised almost half the entire population” (Palmer). Therefore, increasing importance of nonagricultural income before Industrial Revolution. (Examples of home industries include weaving, wool processing, copper, iron, lead and tin manufacturing, leather, paper, glass, porcelain, silk, linen, and cotton.) “Thickening of the countryside”—increase in population and economic activity before Industrial Revolution. Possible effects on women: • Generated additional revenue for needy rural families. • Increased their demand for products and services.  • Familiarized rural inhabitants with industrial processes and cash relationships. • Did not lead to sustained economic growth (Chambers). Industrial Revolution in England, 1760 or 1780: Factory system: • Women as laborers—advantages: smaller fingers to work in between the bobbins; hired for lower wages than men; new machines did not require skilled workers. • 1780—power machinery began huge production of and demand for English cotton textiles. • Same work day (12–14 hours) as before factory system; more tedious, oppressive, harsh treatment and conditions. England’s economic infrastructure: no internal tariffs, weak guilds, monopolies only for inventors. Question 2 Historical Background (continued) Corn Laws 1815: landlords, farmers gained; wage earners suffered.  Peterloo 1819: 113 women injured. SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS that may be cited as having an effect on English women, 1700–1850.  Urbanization: Rapid growth of northern cities: crime, filth, overcrowding, prostitution, slums. Enclosure movement shifted population to city and emerged as Europe’s first urban, industrial economy.  Widening gulf between elite and popular culture, rich and poor; most dramatic in cities: Elites: • Wealth, social position, power, fashion, patronage, connoisseurship, artists, education, special training (medicine, law) discovery, accomplishment in technology and sciences; lessening of superstitions, customs, participation in carnivals, etc. • Upper-class women aided the poor by giving money and service. • Separate theaters by 1700 for rich and poor, unlike Shakespeare’s time. • Homes and furnishings more attenuated. Popular culture: • Elites can participate at will: public amusements, talking with servants. • Subsiding beliefs in superstition and magic. Education and literacy: Economic developments led to education for some women. Access to language/literacy allowed some to rise. Booksellers increased output of fictional romances and fashion magazines for women and began to publish more fiction and poetry by women. Eliza Haywood, The Female Spectator (1744–1756), encouraged improvement in treatment of women and greater “opportunities of enlarging our minds.” Fanny Burney, Evelina or A Young Lady’s Entrance into the World (1778), woman’s perspective. Newspapers such as London Chronicle increasingly directed toward family entertainment, carried advertisements that spurred consumerism and the notion of fashion.  Publishing industry created opportunities for women (and men), hack writers, who produced “potboilers, romances, salacious pamphlets, and gossip sheets, which pandered to low tastes.”  Population expansion: 1725 ff, population increase, death rate decrease due to improved food supply, food prices went up, expanding numbers produced the demand side of the Industrial Revolution. Shared class experiences, upper and middle classes: Eighteenth century “a high degree of social mobility in consequence of a long historical development.” Status derived from better and more comfortable houses, consumer goods, furnishings.  Question 2 Historical Background (continued) Public interactions: tea and coffee houses, taverns (gin, problems associated with alcohol). Corporate nature enforced social hierarchy, but less stratified than on the continent. Primogeniture meant younger sons had to create careers in business: active economic culture. Enlightenment: Movement for reform in social relationships. Discussion of the concept of equality. Mary Wollstonecraft. Participation by women; social role for women/salons. Some freemason lodges accepted women. Marriage and family life (Kagan): Relatively late marriage, women over 23, often already pregnant at marriage. Man often pressured by family or community to marry pregnant woman. Premarital sex common, rare illegitimate births; unmarried living together common practice. Family economies. Women working for pay (perhaps as primary wage earner) may have lessened domestic subordination. Wives often ran business, sold husband’s wares if a craftsman. Widows might remarry to restore labor and skills of male. Reconstituted second family groups. Weakened family ties due to long work hours and separation (Hunt, others). Rise in material standard of living (Kagan): Economic change in created institutionalization of the concepts of style and fashion, which required new products, initiated consumerism. Magazines made even lower-class people aware of style. Middle-class women became indicators of social status: Same duties as upper-class women for organizing, patronizing, etc., but middle-class women isolated from business and politics. Victorian standards supported by popular press, novels, sermons:  • Ideal image of femininity appeared to be “an idle and pallid creature, encased in corset or bustle, who tendency to faint was a sign of delicacy.”  • Reflected values more than reality. Image of idle woman as proof of consumption, status.  • Responsible for maintaining an atmosphere in the home of moral virtue. • Role of devoted mother.  Question 3 Using examples from at least two different states, analyze the key features of the “new monarchies” and the factors responsible for their rise in the period 1450 to 1550. 9–6: Stronger • Has a clear, well-developed thesis. • Is well organized. • Addresses the terms of the question. • Supports the thesis with specific evidence. • May contain minor errors; even a 9 need not be flawless. Indicators for 9–8 • Thesis refers to the way monarchs created strong governments or to the factors that allowed new monarchies to arise. • Addresses both key features of the new monarchies and the factors responsible for their rise. • Addresses a minimum of two countries with balance and depth. • Uses specific factual evidence to support the analysis of both parts of the question. Indicators for 7–6 • Addresses key features of the monarchies but may allude to the factors causing the rise. • Addresses two countries with perhaps only two pertinent features. • Uses specific factual references to support at least one of the countries chosen. • May mention a monarch slightly out of the time period as an example as long as others are correct and factual support is strong. 5–4: Mixed • Contains a thesis, perhaps superficial or simplistic. • Uneven response to the question’s terms. • May contain errors, factual or interpretive. Indicators • Contains a thesis, perhaps superficial or simplistic. • Provides uneven response to the question’s terms. • May contain errors, factual or interpretive. • May discuss two countries but unevenly. • May mention both rise and features but unevenly. • May use only monarchs somewhat outside the time period but not Absolutists. • Discussion may be generalized with a few pertinent details. Question 3 (continued) 3–0 Weaker Indicators for 3–2 • Thesis is confused, or absent, or merely restates the question. • Misconstrues the question or omits major tasks. • May contain major errors. • May use only absolute monarchs. • May use wrong time periods. Indicators for 1–0 • Essays scored 1 or 0 may attempt to address the question but fail to do so. • May have no specific evidence. • May have purely generic references to “monarchs.” • May contain a number of glaring errors. Question 3 Historical Background Factors responsible for the rise of the new monarchies: Population increase Economic growth based on new industries Growth of banking and/or capitalism New world discoveries and their products Growth of towns Social distress Wars Ferdinand and Isabella marriage Features of the new monarchies: Centralization of administration Control of nobility Finding new funding sources Standing army Use of pike, longbow, cannon, guns Diplomacy Dynastic alliances through marriage Control of the Church Common legal system Rise of middle class Development of bureaucracy Hereditary monarchy Specifics of each to indicate analysis: England Henry VII War of Roses ended Star Chamber Ending livery and maintenance Bureaucrats from gentry Avoiding war to avoid noble-controlled Parliament Rebuilding of wool industry Increased power of JPs Henry VIII Creation of new Church Sale of Church lands Refining of administrative departments by T.

the labor theory of value; the concept of “surplus value.” • Social classes are based on economic production. • In industrialized society, bourgeois, capitalist, and proletarian classes have their own class interests. • These lead ultimately to a clash of interests, or “class antagonisms.”  • The inevitable result will be a fierce struggle for dominance between classes. • One result will be the abolition of property, and therefore the creation of a classless society. Marx’s Views on Politics • The state—and therefore government per se—represents bourgeois, capitalist interests. • The proletariat must, therefore, never forget that government works against workers’ interests. • Workers must never imagine that concepts like democracy, religion, and even government-sponsored social legislation will ever improve their lives.  • The urban proletariat should realize their growing power in the industrial system, and should therefore resist government suppression. • The workers will ultimately revolt against their capitalist, government-backed exploiters and replace them as a ruling force. • The state as a consequence will “wither away” and will be replaced by a communist society. • Through the dialectical process, the socialist revolution will spread around the world: “WORKING MEN OF ALL COUNTRIES, UNITE!” Lenin’s Alignment with Marx’s Economic and Political Ideals • Distrust of democratic government. • Hatred of capitalism, especially in its “highest” form (i.e., big business). • A hatred of religion as an expression of bourgeois government’s suppression of the laboring classes. • A loathing of bourgeois exploitation of workers. • A determined commitment to the concept of class struggle. • The withdrawal of Russia from World War I, which he saw as a clash between capitalist states. • War Communism. • Establishment of the Comintern (1919) to spread Communism around the world. Lenin’s Departures from Marx’s Economic and Political Ideals • It is possible to skip over a capitalist stage on the way toward a socialist state. • Capitalism leads inexorably to imperialism and colonialism. • The means of production should be controlled by the state—not as in Marx’s idea by “the association of producers.” • New Economic Policy (NEP). • Use of the party apparatus (i.e., the Communist Party) to orchestrate political revolution—to establish “the dictatorship of the proletariat.”  • The Communist Party must assume the role of “revolutionary vanguard.” • This ruling party, comprised of intellectuals and activists, would then carry out the overthrow of the capitalist-controlled state. • The end result would be realized in a highly centralized political structure, in which all policies were determined by a “central committee.” Question 6 Historical Background (continued) Stalin’s Alignment with Marx’s Ideals on Economics and Politics • Continued resistance to capitalism as the principal mode of economic production. • Class struggle as a means to end bourgeois capitalists’ exploitation of workers. • Like Marx, Stalin saw the value of industrialization and the role to be played by a large industrial workforce. Stalin’s Departures from Marx’s Ideals on Economics and Politics • An expansion of Lenin’s notion of centralized rule by the Communist Party.  • The Party controlled by the Politboro. • Totalitarian rule through a personal dictatorship.  • Development of a centralized administrative system of the Soviet Union. • An almost exclusive concentration on the rapid expansion of industry, particularly heavy industry, at the expense of agricultural production and basic commodities. • Implementation of a series of state-directed Five-Year Plans. • The collectivization of agriculture. • A policy of rule by stark terror and the removal of dissidents by means of a series of purges and use of secret police, backed up by gulags. • “Socialism in one country” (Russian nationalism) more important than the global spread of communism. Question 7 Analyze the economic, technological, and institutional factors responsible for western Europe’s domination of world trade from 1650 to 1800.  9–6: Stronger • Has a clear, well-developed thesis. • Is well organized. • Addresses the terms of the question. • Supports the thesis with specific evidence. • May contain minor errors; even a 9 need not be flawless. Indicators • Contains a clear, well-stated thesis.  • Contains appropriate analysis of all three sets of factors, even if somewhat uneven. • Supports analysis with specific evidence. • May discuss factors prior to 1650, but must engage period from 1650 to 1800. • May contain minor errors; even a 9 need not be flawless. 5–4: Mixed • Contains a thesis, perhaps superficial or simplistic. • Uneven response to the question’s terms. • May contain errors, factual or interpretive. Indicators • Contains a thesis, possibly simplistic, sustained by organization throughout. • Responds to terms of question unevenly, but with some specifics; may omit one set of factors. • Limited awareness of chronological framework of question; may discuss factors prior to 1650. • May contain factual or interpretive errors, particularly of a chronological nature. 3–0: Weaker (Essays scored 1 or 0 may attempt to address the question but fail to do so.) • Thesis is confused, or absent, or merely restates the question  • Misconstrues the question or omits major tasks. • May contain major errors. Indicators • Thesis is superficial, confused, or absent. May simply restate question. • May not address all factors. Will likely discuss only one set of factors. • May have confused chronological understanding. • Likely to contain limited specifics and major errors. Question 7 Historical Background Economic Factors Agricultural Revolution Jethro Tull‘s seed drill (1701) Turnip Townsend (1730s) Introduction of new crops from Americas (potato, maize) Enclosure commercializes agriculture Proto-industrialization (domestic industry) Mercantilist governmental policies Colbert Triangular trade; Columbian exchange; Atlantic system African slave trade Caribbean sugar  European cloth Banking Bank of Amsterdam founded (1609) Bank of England founded (1694) Joint-stock companies English East India Company founded (1600) Became involved in opium trade in eighteenth century (but Opium Wars (1839–42) are too late and reflect nineteenth-century imperialism) Dutch East Indies Company founded (1602) Technological Factors Astrolabe and compass Caravels, better shipping (Dutch flyboats) Gunpowder weapons Scientific Revolution adds to knowledge of astronomy, etc. English Canals (begin to open c. 1760) Industrial Revolution in Britain (c. 1760–80) James Kay’s Flying Shuttle (1733) James Hargreave’s Spinning Jenny (1765) Richard Arkwright’s waterframe (1769, adapted to steam power in 1785) James Watt’s rotary steam engine (1782) drives machinery Edmund Cartwright’s power loom (1787) Institutional Factors Louis XIV (1643–1715)—embodies strong centralized monarchy 1707 United Kingdom established; parliamentary monarchy in England Treaty of Utrecht (1713)—defines boundaries of respective European empires; awareness of balance of power in Europe leading to competition for overseas markets and colonies. Institutionalization of science as cooperative venture: Royal Society of London founded (1660) French Royal Academy of Sciences founded (1666) Education Cult of knowledge connected to the Enlightenment Vocational education, particularly in naval training (e.g., Gresham College) Question 7 Historical Background (continued) “Factories”(trading posts) in India Joseph Dupleix (1697–1763) represents French interests Robert Clive (1725–1774) represents English interests Christian missionary zeal drives exploration/conquest if not necessarily trade Calvinist work ethic and legitimization of commerce as respectable profession Slavery as institution underpins economic factors Racism/cultural superiority institutionalized as European attitudes NOTE: Many of the examples listed above fit under several of the headings.
