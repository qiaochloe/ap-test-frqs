Although it is not necessary for an acceptable response to offer an explicit explanation of the relationship between the evidence offered and the task of the prompt, it must go beyond a mere mention or name-dropping (e.g., “Russia had a history of tyrants in the Romanov dynasty” or “then Stalin happened”). Possible acceptable responses for part (a) (not exhaustive): • Russia’s lack of experience with democratic institutions (though the extent to which the Duma, established after 1905, was “democratic” may be debated) prior to 1917 meant that its people were ill-prepared for the overthrow of the tsar or the Bolshevik takeover. • The politically repressive nature of the tsarist government prior to 1917 gave democratic institutions little or no chance to develop prior to the Revolution. • Russia’s relative lack of economic and educational development prior to 1917 meant that the Russian population as a whole was politically inexperienced and unsophisticated. • Radicalization of the anti-tsarist opposition prior to 1917 meant that many opponents of the tsar were not interested in democratic reform. • Russia’s leaders were oblivious to “public opinion,” especially concerning a potential withdrawal from World War I. • Russia lacked mass-based political movements, such as those that led many other European states into war between 1914 and 1916. • The extent of women’s political participation and electoral suffrage lagged even further behind Western Europe. Additional notes: • Responses that do not connect Russia’s historical experience pre-1917 to political institutions or to “democratic culture” specifically will not earn the point. For example, some responses claim that feudalism persisted in Russia until the Bolshevik Revolution, and others mention serfdom as an economic institution, without addressing the political aspects of the prompt. Merely alluding to a policy of Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, Nicholas I, or any other tsar will not earn the point, unless it is directly related to the thwarting of a “democratic culture” in Russia. • Note that “prior to the Bolshevik Revolution” should be interpreted as any period in Russian history, including the months immediately prior to the Revolution. Short Answer Question 1 (continued) Possible acceptable responses for part (b) (not exhaustive): • The Bolsheviks’ extensive use of repressive techniques — secret police, detentions, prison camps, exile to Siberia — was similar to the tactics of tsarist governments. • Like the tsarist regimes, the Bolshevik regime failed to establish representative/democratic institutions. • Like the tsarist regimes, the Bolsheviks controlled/censored the media. • The cult of personality developing around Lenin (and the eventual embalming of his corpse) could be compared to the sacramental nature of Romanov monarchy. • The expansionist drives of the tsars were now disguised as the advancement of global revolution. • The Civil War with the Mensheviks, driven by competing visions of the future, could be compared with earlier rebellions against central authority, such as the Pugachev or Streltsy uprisings. • Alexandra Kollontai and other female leaders of the Revolution were disappointed by the continuation of hierarchical notions of gender into the new regime. Additional note: Responses that do not connect Russia’s historical experience pre-1917 to the “new autocracy” of the 1920s or 1930s, specifically and in political terms, will not earn the point. Some responses claim the Great Depression as a “continuity” with the economic suffering of peasants in previous centuries and do not address the lack of development of a political culture. Possible acceptable responses for part (c) (not exhaustive): • The Bolshevik regime’s aims were more far-reaching than those of the tsarist regimes: They sought to regulate and control the economy as well as the realm of politics and government (frequent examples are the New Economic Policy and the Five-Year Plans). • The Bolshevik regime did not rely on traditional sources of authority (religion, social hierarchies, hereditary monarchs) to justify its rule, and it claimed to abolish private property and class distinctions. • The Bolshevik regime portrayed itself as progressive, aiming at improving/perfecting the Soviet Union, rather than preserving a (mythical) past. • The degree of ideological purity as a marker of commitment to the Revolution constituted a new governmental priority. • The scale of violence under the Stalinist regime marks a clear departure from repression by the tsars. • The Duma, established in 1905 as a result of a failed revolution, may reflect the beginnings of a “democratic institution.” • Universal suffrage was enacted by the Bolsheviks, at least officially. Additional note: Responses that address Russia’s history during the Cold War (1945–1991) or under Vladimir Putin will not earn the point, as they fall outside the chronological bounds of the passage. Short Answer Question 2 Question-Specific Scoring Guide • One point for describing one way in which the image expresses ideas popularized during the Enlightenment. • One point for describing one way in which the image reflects the policies of the French Revolutionary government’s radical phase. • One point for describing one way in which the ideas in the image continued to influence European political thought after 1815. Scoring Notes To meet the requirement of “describe” in parts (a), (b), and (c), the response must offer a minimally accurate description of some aspect of French Revolutionary ideas referenced by the image and some indication of how that idea relates to the topic of the prompt. Although it is not necessary for an acceptable response to offer an explicit explanation of the relationship between a particular Revolutionary idea and the task of the prompt, the response must go beyond mere mention or name-dropping. For parts (a) and (b) of the question, although the response does not need to explicitly reference the image, it must make at least an implicit reference that signals understanding that ideas from the Enlightenment and/or policies of the French Revolution’s radical phase have a defensible connection to the concepts depicted in the image. Possible acceptable responses for part (a) (not exhaustive): • Image stresses the power of reason — a central belief of the Enlightenment. • Image portrays “ignorance and fanaticism” as the great enemies — reflecting the Enlightenment’s critique of traditional sources of authority and belief systems. • Image portrays the Enlightenment as a process of universal reform, offering broad social benefits such as liberty. • Image stresses the importance of “liberty,” a concept that many Enlightenment philosophes discussed in relation to ideas about natural rights, social contracts, religion, and government. Additional notes: • Simply describing the visual details of the image by itself or rephrasing the image caption is not enough to earn the point; the response must link the image in some way to the ideas it references. • Some responses are attempting art historical readings of the image, particularly noting the Classical themes in the image. This is acceptable as long as the response also responds to the task of the question prompt. Short Answer Question 2 (continued) Possible acceptable responses for part (b) (not exhaustive): • Image’s attack on fanaticism reflects the Jacobin policies of de-Christianization. • Violent imagery of the engraving reflects Robespierre’s/the Jacobins’ willingness to use force to enact their policies. • Image’s championing of reason reflects the Jacobin attempt to establish the Cult of Reason and the Cult of the Supreme Being, as well as providing the support for Robespierre’s Republic of Virtue. • Image’s portrayal of liberty reflects the Jacobin establishment of a new, republican form of government replacing the monarchy. • Image’s portrayal of Liberty’s Phrygian cap, a symbol of the sans-culottes, reflects the significance of popular support for the radical phase of the Revolution, including policies of universal male suffrage and republicanism. Additional note: Although responses do not have to specifically discuss the Jacobins, the prompt specifies that their analysis should focus on the “radical phase” of the Revolution (i.e., 1792–1794). Mentions of Robespierre, the Committee of Public Safety, the Reign of Terror, guillotines and mass executions, the republican calendar, etc. will be important indicators of student knowledge about the shift from the liberal to the radical phase in 1792. Possible acceptable responses for part (c) (not exhaustive): • Post-1815 liberals (in France and elsewhere) continued to portray their struggle in the same terms of rationality and liberty against oppressive tradition. • Revolution of 1830 in France was aimed at broadening liberty, overthrowing a conservative regime to form a more rational, representative government. • Many revolutionaries of 1848 also conceived of their movements in the same terms, as struggles for rational order against reactionary forces. • Metternich (Concert of Europe) and the ideology of conservatism emerged in Europe after 1815 as a reaction against the Enlightenment and French Revolution in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars. • Romanticism inspired nationalism during the 19th century as a reaction against the spread of French Revolutionary ideas during the Napoleonic Wars. • European governments gradually secularized over the 19th century through the implementation of liberal policies, including the legal separation of church and state. • Europeans justified the expansion of overseas empires and the domination of colonized peoples (e.g., “The White Man’s Burden”) through the explanation that Europeans were more “enlightened” and colonized peoples were “ignorant” and “fanatical.” Short Answer Question 2 (continued) Additional notes: • Responses that describe Enlightenment/French Revolutionary influences on European political thought during the 20th century are also acceptable, as long as the response can make a historically defensible case for them. • Responses that focus solely on post-1815 intellectual or scientific influences of the Enlightenment (e.g., germ theory, Darwin’s theory of evolution, Romanticism in literature and art) and do not make any connection to political thought will not earn the point. Short Answer Question 3 Question-Specific Scoring Guide • One point for describing one cause of the Protestant Reformation in England during the reign of Henry VIII. • One point for describing one political effect of the Protestant Reformation in England in the period 1500–1600. • One point for explaining one difference between political effects of the Protestant Reformation in England and the Protestant Reformation in France in the period 1500–1600. Scoring Notes To meet the requirement of “describe” in parts (a) and (b), the response must offer a minimally accurate description of a cause or effect of the Protestant Reformation in England. Although it is not necessary for an acceptable response to offer an explicit explanation of the relationship the Protestant Reformation and the stated cause or effect, the response must go beyond mere mention or name-dropping. Possible acceptable responses for part (a) (not exhaustive): • Henry VIII’s need for a male heir led him to break with the Roman Catholic Church after the pope refused to let him divorce. • Roman Catholic Church in England had large amounts of wealth that the royal government wanted to acquire. • Roman Catholic clergy in England did not answer to the king and often had legal immunity from royal authority. • Roman Catholic Church was seen as corrupt, not living up to its ideals such as poverty and clerical celibacy, by many people in England. Possible acceptable responses for part (b) (not exhaustive): • English monarchy was strengthened as the king (or queen) became head of the English Church as well as head of the secular government. • England became involved in religious wars, particularly with Spain. • Religious strife and tension continued in England among mainstream Protestants (Anglicans), Catholics, and radical Protestants (Puritans), but Protestants came to dominate politics. Short Answer Question 3 (continued) To meet the requirement of “explain” in part (c), the response must offer some account of how or why the Reformation had different effects in England and in France. Because politics and religion were intertwined in this era, reference to politics does not need to be explicit. It is not necessary for the response to offer a fully worked out explanation, but it must go beyond simple description or name-dropping and show how the effects in England and France can be compared. Possible acceptable responses for part (c) (not exhaustive): • Because of the political settlement of the Edict of Nantes, France ended up with a religious minority (the Huguenots) that was a “state within a state,” unlike England which had no such arrangements for religious minorities. • Since the French monarchy, unlike the English, did not break with papacy, France remained a majority-Catholic country. • Because Protestantism did not gain such a wide hold in France, religious conflict within the country was largely Protestant vs. Catholic, rather than the increasing tensions between Protestants seen in England. Short Answer Question 4 Question-Specific Scoring Guide • One point for describing one cause of Great Britain’s early industrialization in the period 1700–1800. • One point for describing one effect of Great Britain’s industrialization on the European balance of power in the period 1800–1900. • One point for explaining one political reaction to industrialization within Great Britain in the period 1800–1900. Scoring Notes To meet the requirement of “describe” in parts (a) and (b), the response must offer a minimally accurate description of a cause or effect of British industrialization. Although it is not necessary for an acceptable response to offer an explicit explanation of the relationship between British industrialization and the stated cause or effect, the response must go beyond mere mention or name-dropping. Although responses do not need an explanation, vague statements such as “the population grew” should not receive credit. In addition, inaccurate responses such as “Britain was not engaged in war during this time” or “railroads caused industrialization” should not receive credit. Some responses might cite the printing press or the cotton gin as a cause and should not receive credit. The evidence should indicate a clear and valid cause of British industrialization. Possible acceptable responses for part (a) (not exhaustive): • Britain had a stable well-developed banking system that could easily fund industrial development. • Britain had easy access to key raw materials such as coal and iron. • Britain had a tradition of entrepreneurship and limited government intervention in the market. • Britain was geographically compact and easily formed a national market. • Britain had no internal tariffs or trade barriers. • Britain had large amounts of wealth accumulated from global trade. • Britain was politically stable, which encouraged economic growth and innovation. • Britain did not have to devote as much money or resources to its military as did many Continental countries. • Britain had many rivers and ports, which enabled trade and shipping. • Britain had many rivers and canals, which allowed for developments in water power and/or inventions such as the Spinning Jenny. • The Enclosure Movement created a labor force for factories. • Britain was not impacted internally from warfare and therefore could focus more on industrialization. • Britain embraced the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment thought, which encouraged research, science, and new technical inventions. • Britain funded the development of science through the Royal Academy. • The cottage industry or putting-out system created a foundation for the textile industry and/or early manufacturing. Short Answer Question 4 (continued) • Britain harnessed and improved steam power. • Britain had a strong navy and controlled the seas. • The Agricultural Revolution promoted greater mechanization and production, which created more technological advancements. Note on chronological scope for part (b): It is not necessary for a response to cover the entire century as long as it touches on a significant effect within the correct time period. To earn credit, the response only needs to state a general or minimal shift in the balance of power. Possible acceptable responses for part (b) (not exhaustive): • As a result of industrialization, Britain became a more powerful nation. • Britain was the top power in Europe due to new technology and industry. • As Britain industrialized, the balance of power tipped in its favor. • Industrial power and wealth allowed Britain to solidify its position as one of the dominant European powers in the 1800s. • Britain’s greater wealth (in part from industrialization) was a key element in defeating Napoleon. • Britain’s colonial expansion, fueled by industrialization, encouraged other European countries to compete for colonies in the 1800s. • The benefits of industrialization to Britain led Continental governments to intervene to encourage industrial development, leading to greater economic competition. • Britain and France won the Crimean war over less industrialized Russia. • The failure of the Continental System exemplified Britain’s dominant role in Europe. • Germany’s efforts to industrialize created competition with Britain and a shift in the balance of power. • Industrialization provided Britain with advantages when nations scrambled for Africa, which fueled competition. • Western Europe industrialized more successfully than Eastern Europe, which shifted the balance of power to the western countries. To meet the requirement of “explain” in part (c), the response must offer some account of how or why the British political system responded to industrialization in the 1800s. It is not necessary for the response to offer a fully worked out explanation, but it must go beyond simple description or name-dropping. Responses must address a political reaction within Great Britain. Possible acceptable responses for part (c) (not exhaustive): • Increased wealth and influence of industrial regions led to political reform and expanded representation (Chartist movement, Reform Bills). • Social and economic problems associated with factories and rapid urbanization encouraged social reform movements. • Social and economic problems associated with factories and rapid urbanization led the British government to begin to regulate working conditions (Factory Act, Ten-Hour Act, Mines Act). • Growth of working class led to politically active trade unions and eventually the formation of the Labour Party. Short Answer Question 4 (continued) • The Luddites protested and attacked factories and smashed machinery. • Workers embraced the ideas of Karl Marx and communism. • Women protested working conditions, organized, and created suffrage movements. • The movement of population to urban centers created a shift in voting and representation in Parliament. • The repeal of the Corn Laws was promoted by industrialists. • Due to superior technology such as that displayed at the Crystal Palace exhibition, Britain experienced a rise in pride and nationalism. Question 1 — Document-Based Question Maximum Possible Points: 7 “Evaluate whether or not the Catholic Church in the 1600s was opposed to new ideas in science.” Points  Rubric  Notes  A: Thesis/Claim (0-1)  Responds to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis/claim that establishes a line of reasoning. (1 point) To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt rather than restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion.  The thesis must take a position on whether the Catholic Church in the 1600s was opposed to new ideas in science, with some indication of the reason for taking that position. • “The Catholic Church was opposed to new ideas as it put the Bible under heavy criticizing, caused people and clergy to question teachings, and provided evidence that the sun was the center of the universe and not the Earth.” • “The Catholic Church in the 1600s was not opposed to new ideas in science due to the willingness of the Catholic Church to listen and learn while also  having the desire to conduct science themselves.” • “The Catholic Church opposed new scientific ideas because they threatened the Church’s interpretation of scripture.”  B: Contextualization (0-1)  Describes a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. (1 point) To earn this point, the response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that occur before, during, or continue after the time frame of the question. This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference.  To earn the point, the essay must accurately describe a broader context relevant to the Catholic Church in the early modern period and/or new ideas in science. Examples might discuss the following topics, with appropriate elaboration: • The Protestant Reformation • The Catholic Reformation • Scientific Revolution • Geocentricism • The development and spread of the Gutenberg printing press  Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) C: Evidence (0-3)  Evidence from the Documents: Uses the content of at least three documents to address the topic of the prompt. (1 point) OR Supports an argument in response to the prompt using at least six documents. (2 points)  To earn 1 point, the response must accurately describe — rather than simply quote — the content from at least three of the documents to address the topic of the Catholic Church’s stance on new scientific ideas. To earn 2 points, the response must accurately describe — rather than simply quote — the content from at least six documents. In addition, the response must use the content from the documents to support an argument in response to the prompt. Evidence from the documents may include such examples as: • Cardinal Bellarmine upholding the geocentric view of the world • Galileo’s claims that geocentrism is a result of not understanding the Bible • Jesuit astronomers, such as Schreiner, observing sunspots  Evidence beyond the Documents:  Typically, statements credited as evidence from outside the documents will be more specific details relevant to  Uses at least one additional piece of  an argument, analogous to the function of evidence  specific historical evidence (beyond that  drawn from the documents.  found in the documents) relevant to an  argument about the prompt.

Paolo Foscarini  • Advocates for Copernicus’s model of planetary movements in a heliocentric system  • Notes that many are questioning the Ptolemaic model based on new observations (situation) • Discusses the fear many scholars have of contradicting the Bible in endorsing the Copernican model (POV/audience)  2. Cardinal Bellarmine  • Replies to Foscarini and affirms the Catholic belief in the geocentric model in order to uphold the authority of the Church  • Cites the Council of Trent in order to remind Foscarini of the danger of contradicting scripture (purpose/audience) • Is acting as an agent of the Catholic Reformation by citing the Council of Trent (situation)  3. Christoph Greinberger  • Advocates for Jesuits to be allowed to think more freely about descriptions of the universe  • Is countering the idea that scientific observations are against scripture (purpose/audience) • As a German Jesuit mathematician, he wants more freedom to investigate new ideas (POV)  4. Galileo Galilei  • Claims that contradictions between the Bible and heliocentrism are attributable to the “abstruse” language of the Bible  • Is acting in his own self-interest as an astronomer who believes in the heliocentric model and is persecuted as a result (POV) • Galileo seeks the support of political authorities as sponsors of science and to counterbalance the Church (audience/purpose)  5. Maria Celeste Galilei  • Claims that the Pope supports Galileo based on letters sent to Galileo  • To reassure his daughter, Galileo may have been exaggerating his support from the Pope (purpose) • As a radical nun, Suor Arcangela is more likely to tolerate dissenting views such as those of Maria and Galileo (situation)  6. Sunspots image  • Shows Christoph Scheiner, a German Jesuit astronomer, observing sunspots  • Shows Jesuit astronomical research to a broader educated public (audience) • Places the Jesuit researchers in the best possible light as scholars and men of faith (POV)  7. Critique of Descartes  • French Jesuit school rejects Descartes’s ideas as heretical  • Standing for traditional order against Descartes’s more direct challenge to scriptural authority (purpose) • Sees Descartes’s model as undermining Church authority (POV)  Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Introductory notes: • Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently, e.g., a student could earn a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim. • Accuracy: The components of this rubric require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, the essay may contain errors that do not detract from the overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. • Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. Note: Student samples (when available) are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. A. Thesis/Claim (0-1 point) The thesis must take a position on whether the Catholic Church was opposed to new ideas in science, with some indication of the reason for taking that position. Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion, which is not necessarily limited to the first or last paragraph. Examples of acceptable theses: • “Thus, the Catholic Church in the 1600s was split between those who believed in science and wanted to reconcile it with Catholic tradition and those who oppose it because it undermined Catholic doctrine.” (The response addresses the prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes a line of reasoning.) • “Although there were individual members of the clergy who were willing to accept new ideas in science, the Church as an institution was generally opposed to these ideas because they contrasted traditional interpretation of scripture, traditional scientific thought, and common ideas in philosophy.” (The response addresses the prompt with a robust evaluative claim that establishes a line of reasoning.) • “However, in the 1600s, the Catholic Church strongly opposed new developments in Science as they considered these developments to be against the Bible.” (The response addresses the prompt with a claim that establishes a minimally acceptable line of reasoning.) Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Example of unacceptable theses: • “Although it is a commonly-held belief today that the Catholic Church is anti-science and doesn’t accept new ideas in history, this is a miscategorization of the Church’s beliefs at times.” (The response acknowledges the terms of the question, but the line of reasoning is nonspecific and essentially repeats the terms of the prompt. If this statement was immediately followed or preceded by another sentence suggesting a valid reason for taking this position, then the two sentences taken together could receive credit.) • “People during the 16th-17th centuries began to realize that there was another view of the universe that made more sense to our world but went against the Catholic Church. This reveals that the Catholic Church opposed new ideas in science during the 1600s.” (The response merely indicates the position that will be argued without giving any indication as to the line of reasoning. If this statement was immediately followed or preceded by another sentence suggesting a valid reason for taking this position, then the two sentences taken together could receive credit.) • “The Catholic Church in the 1600’s were opposed and not opposed to the new ideas being introduced in the 1600’s.” (The response addresses the prompt by merely rephrasing it.) B. Contextualization (0-1 point) Responses earn 1 point for contextualization by describing a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. To earn this point, the response must accurately and explicitly connect the context of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that occur before, during, or continue after the time frame of the question. This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference. To earn the point, the essay must accurately describe a broader context relevant to the Catholic Church in the early modern period and/or new ideas in science. Examples of acceptable contextualization: • “The 1600’s in Europe was a time of intellectual change. The rediscovery of classical texts during the Renaissance also reintroduced Greco-Roman scientific thought from the likes of Aristotle and Ptolemy along with reasoning and logic. However, with more advanced technological innovations, such as the telescope and microscope, closer observation of the natural world has lead leading scientists such as Tycho Brahe, Copernicus, and Galileo to question the traditional Ptolemaic beliefs, the scientific viewpoint of the Catholic Church.” (The response relates scientific development over time to challenge the position of the Catholic Church.) • “The Scientific Revolution began in the Seventeenth century. It consisted of using reasoning and observation to know the truth (René Descartes and Francis Bacon). As a result, scientists such as Nicholas Copernicus observed to find new truths. Scientists believed that the truth can never be given and can only be learnt by doubting and use of logic. Copernicus developed the heliocentric theory. This theory stated that the sun, not the earth, was the center of the Solar System. This contradicted from the geocentric view of the earth being the center while the sun, moon and planets orbited it. The geocentric view was accepted for centuries and was taught by the Catholic Church.” (The response recognizes the development of new scientific evidence and relates it to the traditional beliefs of the Catholic Church.) Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Examples of unacceptable contextualization: • “Prior to common knowledge, it was believed that the universe revolved around the Earth as stated in the Holy Scriptures. The Catholic Church promoted this idea for many years, however it is known that those who opposed the Church are punished.” (The response attempts to lay the foundation for the Church’s geocentric stance but does so vaguely without providing sufficient information.) • “The Enlightenment was happening during this time period, through it emerged many new ideas in both philosophy and science. A more rational and secular way of thinking was becoming popular. Many Enlightenment ideas contradicted those of the Church. However, members of the Catholic Church had a hard time denying clear evidence and over time began to view it as a possibility.” (The response relating the Enlightenment to the Scientific Revolution is incorrect.) Students may choose to discuss such potentially relevant examples of context as: • The Catholic Reformation and the Council of Trent • The educational mission of the Jesuit order • The spread of the printing press and scientific ideas • The wars of religion and diminishing Catholic political authority C. Evidence (0-3 points) a) Document Content — Addressing the Topic (1 point) In order to achieve the first point, the response must use the content of at least three documents to address the topic of the prompt (1 point). To earn 1 point for evidence from the documents, the response must accurately describe — rather than simply quote — the content from at least three of the documents to address the topic of the Catholic Church’s reaction to the Scientific Revolution. Example of describing the content of a document: • (Document 2): “In document 2, a letter from Cardinal Bellarmine to Paolo Antonio Foscarini, Cardinal Bellarmine says that Copernicus’s theory is dangerous, and that interpreting the Bible in your own way is against the Catholic religion.” (The response provides an accurate summary of the document.) b) Document Content — Supporting an Argument (1 point) In order to achieve the second point for evidence from the documents, the response needs to support an argument in response to the prompt by accurately using the content of at least six documents (2 points). The six documents do not have to be used in support of a single argument, but they can be used across subarguments or to address counterarguments. Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Examples of supporting an argument using the content of a document: • (Document 1): “The criticism of the Catholic Church for new scientific ideas is apparent, but there was some acceptance present within the community. The account of a Catholic monk in document 1 expresses the uncertainty in the community of which side to believe. The Catholic monk recognizes that Copernicus’ theory is valid but after which he mentions how it has been suppressed by the Church because of its disalignment with the Church’s values.” (The response connects the content of the document to an argument about the debate on heliocentric ideas within the Catholic Church.) • (Document 6): “A Jesuit astronomer is shown using new scientific technologies like the telescope to investigate sunspots. Sunspots proved an imperfection in the Heavenly Bodies which were said by the Church to be perfect. His investigation and published book go against the belief of the Church.” (The response successfully uses evidence from the documents to support a line of argument.) c) Evidence beyond the Documents (1 point) The response must use at least one additional piece of specific historical evidence (beyond that found in the documents) relevant to an argument that addresses the topic of the Catholic Church’s reaction to the Scientific Revolution (1 point). To earn this point, the evidence must be described, and it must be more than a phrase or reference. This additional piece of evidence must be different from the evidence used to earn the point for contextualization. Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence from outside the documents will typically be more specific details relevant to an argument, analogous to the function of evidence drawn from the documents. Example of providing an example or additional piece of specific evidence beyond the documents relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt: • “Furthermore, Galileo was imprisoned by the Catholic Church for his ‘heretic’ ideas, which implies that the Church feared that his new ideas regarding science would eventually lead to the deterioration of power held by the Catholic Church.” (The response provides accurate outside information relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt.) Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) D. Analysis and Reasoning (0-2 points) Document Sourcing (1 point) For at least three documents, the response explains how or why the document’s point of view, purpose, historical situation, and/or audience is relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt (1 point). To earn this point, the response must explain how or why — rather than simply identifying — the document’s point of view, purpose, historical situation, or audience is relevant to an argument addressing the prompt for each of the three documents sourced. Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s point of view: • (Document 2): “His point of view is also essential in understanding the Church’s position on new scientific thought as Bellarmine was a high ranking Cardinal and thus was a reflection of the ideas held by the Church hierarchy.” (The response provides sourcing regarding the point of view of the author relevant to his position within the Catholic Church.) Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s purpose: • (Document 1): “The Catholic monk and scientist believed that Copernicus’ theory was right in a book he wrote. As a Catholic himself he was aware this theory contradicts the Church doctrine. However, he was still hoping for other people to learn about the new theory and this is his purpose of writing this book. His audience was other intellectuals like him, he tried to express concerns he had regarding the church and wanted to get some feedback from his peers.” (The response successfully connects the document’s purpose to an argument relevant to the topic of the prompt.) Example of acceptable explanation of the relevance of the historical situation of a document: • (Document 5): “Galileo asked his daughter to keep the letters from the Pope private. It speaks volumes that the Pope of the Catholic Church had to be secretive about his support for a scientist.” (The response successfully connects the document’s historical situation to an argument relevant to the topic of the prompt.) Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the audience: • (Document 7): “This critique from a Jesuit College is aimed at those who may want to follow Descartes thoughts and believe it; moreover, by claiming those who may want to follow Descartes reasoning are heretics, it further shows their intent to keep people from going away from traditional Catholic thinking like Protestants did.” (The response successfully connects the document’s audience to an argument relevant to the topic of the prompt.) Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Demonstrating Complex Understanding (1 point) The response demonstrates a complex understanding of the historical motivations and factors that influenced the Catholic Church’s reaction to the Scientific Revolution, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the question. This understanding must be part of an argument, not merely a phrase or reference. Demonstrating a complex understanding might include: • Explaining nuance of motivation by analyzing how different elements of the Church had different goals and motivations in dealing with the implications of the Scientific Revolution • Explaining how the Church both opposed and supported scientific investigation as an attempt of Church authorities to maintain control over religion, knowledge, and education • Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across periods, such as comparing the response of the Catholic Church to the Scientific Revolution to the Church’s response in dealing with Luther and the Protestant Reformation • Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across the documents and outside evidence • Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence, such as pointing out the considerations behind the Church’s reluctance to embrace all aspects of the Scientific Revolution. Examples of demonstrating complex understanding: • The response demonstrates nuance by weaving the documents together to show that while some elements of the Church hierarchy maintained traditional views, others, such as the Jesuit scholars, were more willing to question tradition and engage with the new discoveries of the Scientific Revolution. • The response uses multiple causes of the Reformation and wars of religion to show that the Church was concerned about losing its authority and was considering the benefits and drawbacks of new scientific ideas such as heliocentrism. These ideas could be seen as undermining Scripture, but also risked undermining the Church if empirically verifiable observations and discoveries were rejected. • Using documents and outside evidence, the response corroborates its claim that the Church hardened its stance over time, using the example of Galileo’s heresy trial as evidence, as well as the Inquisition and the rejection of Descartes’s and Newton’s models of the universe. • The response connects the Church’s actions in the 1500s in response to the Protestant Reformation and the wars of religion with the Church’s actions in response to the new science. Question 2 — Long Essay Question “Evaluate the most significant effect of state centralization by European monarchs during the period 1450–1648.” Maximum Possible Points: 6 Points  Rubric  Notes  A: Thesis/Claim (0–1)  Thesis/Claim: Responds to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis/claim that establishes a line of reasoning. (1 point) To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt, rather than merely restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion.  The thesis statement must make a historically defensible claim about the most significant effect of state centralization by European monarchs during the period 1450–1648, with some indication of the reasoning for making that claim. • “Therefore, whereas the depravation of rights and numerous wars were significant impacts of state centralization by European monarchs, neither left such a lasting impact as economic decline caused by the central governments needs for military spending and displays of grandeur to maintain its power over its people.” • “The most significant effect of state centralization was the lessening of the power of  both nobles and the clergy.” • “The most significant effect of state centralization was the creation of strong, national armies because countries could wage war and put down internal conflicts.” • “Centralization of European states by their monarchs resulted in increased warfare; this was due to religious beliefs becoming forced on citizens unwillingly, instigating backlash.”  Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) B: Contextualization(0–1)  Contextualization: Describes a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. (1 point) To earn this point, the response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that occur before, during, or continue after the time frame of the question. This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or a reference.  To earn this point, the essay must accurately describe a context relevant to state centralization by European monarchs during the period 1450–1648. Examples of context might include the following, with appropriate elaboration: • Protestant Reformation • Voyages of exploration • Wars of Religion • Military Revolution • Feudalism/manorial system • Middle Ages/Renaissance  C: Evidence(0–2)  Evidence: Provides specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt.

(1 point) To earn the first point, the response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument about the most significant effect of state centralization by European monarchs during the period 1450–1648, although the reasoning might be uneven, imbalanced, or inconsistent. OR Complexity: Demonstrates a complex understanding of the historical development that is the focus of prompt, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the prompt. (2 points)  Examples of using historical reasoning might include: • Establishing a causal relationship between state centralization by monarchs and an effect of that centralization and explaining the connections between cause and effect • Providing a broad category of effects of state centralization, such as religious change, and then discussing subcategories/examples in order to support a broader argument regarding the most significant effect • Describing change over time or elaborating on the changes and continuities that occurred over the period covered by the topic of the prompt OR Demonstrating complex understanding might include: • Explaining the most significant effect of state centralization, and noting that other effects were also significant and interrelated • Explaining how multiple countries underwent changes as a result of state centralization • Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time by discussing the development of  To earn the second point, the response must demonstrate a complex understanding of the effects of state centralization in Europe in the period from 1450 to 1648.

Complexity should emerge from the essay’s argumentation and use of evidence, and while it does not have to be present throughout the essay, the complexity point should consist of substantial elaboration.  If response is completely blank, enter --for all four score categories: A, B, C, and D.  Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) Scoring Notes Introductory notes: • Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a student could earn a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim. • Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, responses may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. • Clarity: Exam responses should be considered first drafts, and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 point) Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim about the most significant effect of state centralization by European monarchs during the period 1450–1648, with some indication of the reasoning for making that claim. Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion, which does not have to be contained in the first or last paragraph. The thesis is not required to encompass the entirety of the period, but it must identify a relevant development or developments in the period. Examples of acceptable theses: • “The state centralization by European monarchs between 1450-1648 caused the entire landscape of Europe to become more powerful and well-off: politically, strong leaders such as Louis XIV and Peter the Great improved their countries standing; socially, religion was able to become more centralized and controlled; most importantly, economically, centralization caused overseas colonization and mercantilism.” (The response makes a historically defensible statement linking the development of state centralization in Europe to increased monarchical power over economic and religious matters within states, and to increased international prestige and competition between states.) • “The political centralization of European monarchs most significantly led to religious conflicts and changes that opened Europe up to a sense of intellectual freedom unlike ever before though the religious developments in Britain, France, and the HRE.” (The response links political centralization to challenges to established religious authority. There is a line of reasoning established in the thesis that is carried through the body of the response.) Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) • “From 1450-1648, European monarchs centralized their power to drastically lower the power of the nobility, establishing absolutism.” (The response links the development of centralized European monarchical power from 1450 to 1648 to the decline in noble influence, allowing for the rise of absolutism. The body of the response further illustrates the ways in which centralized state authority resulted in the decline of the power of the aristocracy.) Examples of unacceptable theses: • “This centralization or inability to entirely centralize crafted the European balance of power for only like the past six hundred years on and also the French Revolution and the Enlightenment.” (There is no historically defensible claim or stance relevant to the prompt.) • “The most significant effect of state centralization by European monarchs was the extent of power of the monarch, as it resulted in economic damage from the spending of the monarch and in future political reform to shape the next governments.” (The attempt at thesis is historically indefensible and does not clearly describe economic difficulties or provide any indication of types of political reforms or government changes.) • “Caused by the political instability and new states found from attempts and successes of state centralization, the massive and deadly European Wars of the early modern era were significant for their resulting religious pluralism and destruction they wrought on Europe.” (The thesis fails to identify the most significant effect of state centralization and makes generalizations about religion and war.) B. Contextualization (0–1 point) Responses earn 1 point by describing a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. To earn this point, the response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that occurred before or during or continued after the time frame of 1450 to 1648. This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or a reference. To earn the point the essay must accurately describe a context relevant to state centralization by European monarchs during the period 1450–1648. Examples might include the following, with appropriate elaboration: • Age of Exploration • The Protestant Reformation • Wars of Religion • Feudalism • Middle Ages • Peter the Great/Catherine the Great/Joseph II • Enlightened absolutism Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) Examples of acceptable contextualization: • “After the fall of Rome, Europe entered a dark age. After the dark age was over in 1450, European monarchs decide to centralize their states, though Poland was a notable exception. The most significant effect of state centralization was the shift of power from nobles to the monarchy. The shift in power increased the monarchies power, suppressed manoralism and created new conflicts.” (The response earned contextualization for clearly linking the shift in political power from feudal lords in the Middle Ages to later monarchs as resulting from state centralization.) • “During the fall of the Roman Empire, Europe became very divided, held together by a thread of the Catholic Church. The nobility as able to gain much power over their respected lands. Without a strong king to keep the nobility in check, the nobles fought each other for a very long time. All of this was about to change with the Crusades, Black Death, and the rise of towns, when the system of feudalism began to decline. Because of this, kings are now able to collect more taxes, have a standardized army of many common folk, and not knighted noblemen, and keep nobles in check.” (The response successfully relates broader events in the Roman Empire and Middle Ages to state centralization by European monarchs in the early modern period.) • “During the years 1450-1648, European monarchs consolidated power, centralizing their state. ‘New Monarchies’ arose in Spain, England and France and worked to consolidate power as outlined by Machiavelli’s ‘The Prince.’ ‘The Prince’ called for a ruler who was strong minded, willing to remove all noble influence and threats and able to ignore morality in making decisions.” (The response mentions multiple countries and connects state centralization in the early modern period to Renaissance-era political theory.) Note: In order to earn this point the response should clearly connect the relevant contextual information to the topic. A mere passing reference to another event or time period, such as the Middle Ages, does not suffice for this point. Examples of unacceptable contextualization: • “In America, we have checks and balances to make sure no branch of government gets too powerful. There have been dictatorships with all the power such as Vladimir Lenin and Hitler.” (The response fails to link historical context to the topic of the prompt, and details are too far removed from the time frame of the prompt to be considered relevant contextualization.) • “What also came from the Italian Renaissance was Christian denominations such as Lutheranism, birthing the Protestant Reformation. Due to sudden beliefs in Religions other than Catholicism, nations became incredibly decentralized.” (The response provides factually inaccurate background information, and also it fails to link religious changes in the Renaissance to state centralization.) • “This began during the Renaissance and ended with the end of the religious wars, meaning there was lots of tension and pressure in Europe.” (While the response refers to a potentially relevant context, it does not link this development to the centralization of state power by monarchs.) Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) C. Evidence (0–2 points) Evidence Responses earn 1 point by providing at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt. Responses can earn this point without earning the point for a thesis statement. To earn this point, the response must identify specific historical examples of evidence relevant to the topic of state centralization by European monarchs during the period 1450–1648. These examples of evidence must be different from the information used to earn the point for contextualization. Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence will typically be more specific information. Examples of evidence used might include: • Consolidation of Habsburg dominions • Peace of Augsburg • Peace of Westphalia • Edict of Nantes • English Civil War • Mercantilism Examples of successful use of evidence: • “As knowledge of the New World spread after its exploration by Christopher Columbus in 1492, countries wanted to gain more land, materials and subsequently power by gaining land in the new world. This led for intense competition for this land. Mercantilism states that the supply of materials such as gold and silver is limited and for a country to be more powerful than another country it must have more of these supplies/materials.” (Response provides accurate evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt, which is further explained in the body of the essay as it relates to economic competition between England, France, and Spain.) • “In Spain, Ferdinand and Isabella sponsored voyages of Christopher Columbus in 1492. His voyages to the Americas brought wealth to Spain in the form of precious metals and new goods such as sugar. Second, with higher taxes and wealth from overseas colonies, monarchs were able to maintain large standing armies, for example Louis XIV fought several wars and gained much territory.” (Response uses specific evidence from multiple countries to show the effect of state centralization on a country’s economy and ability to acquire colonies.) Note: These statements could be credited as evidence supporting an argument if their placement in the essay or additional connective language made it clear that they were being offered in support of a particular point. Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) OR Supports an Argument Responses earn 2 points if they support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant examples of evidence. To earn the second point the response must use specific historical evidence to support an argument regarding state centralization by European monarchs during the period 1450–1648. Examples of successfully supporting an argument with evidence: • “The English Civil War occurred in England due to Charles I attempting to rule without parliament. For 11 years, he ruled without Parliament, and then called them back for money that he needed to solve militaristic issues. He refused to let Parliament stay, and when Charles I began arresting major Parliament opposers, the English Civil War began. Monarchs gained so much power throughout the 15th to the 17th centuries, that they did not want to give power to the people. Therefore, after the time of absolute monarchs, people began to want constitutional monarchy.” (Response successfully uses evidence to support a line of argument that links the centralization of state power to civil war and further to the development of constitutionalism.) • “New monarchs encouraged exploration overseas on behalf of the nation. For instance, Henry the Navigator in Portugal commissioned Cabral and da Gama to explore the New World and establish trading posts, bringing prosperity to Portugal. Second, state centralization brought about the market revolution as centralized nations were able to harness resources brought in by overseas exploration and establish trade and production. State centralization increased regulation, standardization, and efficiency, encouraging economic growth. Due to systems such as mercantilism, joint-stock companies, and new industries, state centralization ultimately revolutionized the European economy and promoted economic growth.” (Response successfully uses evidence to connect state centralization to economic improvements in Portugal.) D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points) Historical Reasoning Responses earn 1 point by using historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument concerning the most significant effect of state centralization by European monarchs during the period 1450–1648. To earn this point, the response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument, although the reasoning might be uneven, imbalanced, or inconsistent. Examples of using historical reasoning skills: • Establishing a causal relationship between state centralization by monarchs and an effect of that centralization and following through on that relationship in a coherent argument. Examples may include the development of mercantilism, national armies, and colonization. • Providing a broad category of effects of state centralization, such as religious change, and then developing into subcategories/examples in order to support a broader argument. Examples may analyze state control over religion in England, France, Spain, and the Holy Roman Empire. Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) • Describing change over time, elaborating on the changes and continuities that occurred over the period covered by the topic of the prompt. Examples could include changes from the feudal system of the Middle Ages with decentralized monarchies to the consolidation of state power by the New Monarchs, or a continuation of centralization into Enlightened despotism. • Comparing state centralization in western European nations to decentralization in eastern European nations, or comparing state centralization between western European nations. OR Complexity Responses earn 2 points by demonstrating a complex understanding of state centralization by European monarchs during the period 1450–1648. Demonstrating complex understanding might include: • Analyzing the nuance of an issue by explaining the most significant effect of state centralization, and noting that other factors were also significant and interrelated • Explaining how different countries underwent different changes as a result of state centralization • Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time by discussing the development of Enlightened Absolutism as a continuation of the trends from 1450 to 1648 • Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering evidence that supports an alternate position Note: This demonstration of complex understanding must be part of an argument, not merely a phrase or reference. Complexity should emerge from the essay’s argumentation and use of evidence, and while it does not have to be present throughout the essay, the complexity point should consist of substantial elaboration. Examples demonstrating complexity: • The response analyzes links between state centralization and its impact on politics, religion, and the economy, prioritizing one effect over the others. The response analyzes the ways in which state centralization changed attitudes toward European politics and religion, while discussing how economic effects were more significant. • The response analyzes change and continuity over time. The response explains how state centralization in the 16th and 17th centuries led to the development of absolutism and constitutionalism in the 18th and 19th centuries. • The response analyzes causation between state centralization and the growth of monarchical power, linking it to the decline of church power and that of the old nobility, and to the Age of Exploration and the rise of a “new aristocracy.” The response discusses Louis XIV and his creation of Versailles for the purpose of weakening the nobility, links the Protestant Reformation to state centralization in England, and links the development of state centralization in Spain to voyages of discovery. The response is structured within a clear framework, connecting evidence to the argument and clearly analyzing the nuance of the issue by explaining the most significant effect of state centralization, and by noting that other factors are also significant and interrelated. • The response compares developments in multiple European countries and discusses the policies of multiple European monarchs, and it discusses the differences between countries that centralized and those that did not: Spain and France are contrasted against the Holy Roman Empire and Poland. Question 3 — Long Essay Question “Evaluate the most significant effect of population growth in Europe within the period 1700–1800.” Maximum Possible Points: 6 Points  Rubric  Notes  A: Thesis/Claim (0–1)  Thesis/Claim: Responds to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis/claim that establishes a line of reasoning.

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 point) Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim about the most significant effect of population growth in Europe within the period 1700–1800, with a clear line of reasoning for making that claim. Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion, which does not have to be contained in the first or last paragraph. The thesis is not required to encompass the entirety of the period, but it must identify a relevant development or developments within the period. Examples of acceptable theses: • “The most significant effect of population growth in Europe during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was that it contributed to industrialization by expanding urban areas and providing more labor for factories.” (The response makes a clear and historically defensible claim that the most significant effect of population growth in the 18th century was the Industrial Revolution, and it establishes a line of reasoning as to why the Industrial Revolution was the most significant effect of population growth.) • “The most significant effect of this population growth was the growth of the middle-low class because it resulted in lasting economic changes such as a greater amount of farming, social reform, and focus on something other than the high nobility.” (The response makes a clear and historically defensible claim in the thesis that the most significant effect of population growth was the rise of the middle class and establishes a line of reasoning as to why the rise of the middle class was significant.) Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) • “In conclusion, overpopulation in cities caused poor living conditions due to sanitation services not being able to accomodate the population growth.” (The response makes a clear and historically defensible claim and establishes a line of reasoning as to why the stated development was significant. Although the valuation of poor living conditions is not explicitly identified as the most significant effect of population growth, such sentiment is implicit. The response also demonstrates that a thesis may appear in the conclusion. ) • “The most significant effect of population growth in Europe within the period 1700-1800 was the growth and modernization of countries, who were able to establish colonies to grow more foods.” (Although the linkage is indirect between population growth, modernization, and colonization, the response makes a historically defensible claim and leads to a line of reasoning.) Examples of unacceptable theses: • “The most significant effect of population growth in Europe within the period 1700-1800 was disease.” (While the statement makes an acceptable claim, it does not offer a line of reasoning as to why disease was significant.) • “The most significant effect Europe’s growing population had was its implications on hygene and medical advancement.” (While the statement makes an acceptable claim, it does not offer a line of reasoning as to why hygienic and medical advancements were significant.) B. Contextualization (0–1 point) Responses earn 1 point by describing a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. To earn this point the response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that occurred before or during or continued after the time frame of 1700 to 1800. This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or a reference. To earn the point the essay must accurately describe a context relevant to population growth in Europe within the period 1700–1800. Examples might include the following, with appropriate elaboration: • The Commercial Revolution • The Industrial Revolution • The Agricultural Revolution • The spread of Enlightenment ideas • The Scientific Revolution • Prior depopulation due to bubonic plague Examples of acceptable contextualization: • “In the period of 1700-1800 most if not all European countries were practicing mercantilism, where countries have colonies which bring in money from new lands shaping markets and economies. This in turn primed Europe for large scale population growth, because it gave the potential for new markets.” (The response relates a prior commercial development to the topic of population growth in Europe in the 1700s.) Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) • “With the introduction of new and improved agriculture techniques, such as the use of fertilizer and Jethro Tull’s iron plow, as well as an improved understanding of medicine thanks to names like Harvey, Paracelus, and Vesuvius, the population of Europe grew steadily during the period 1700-1800. (The response relates relevant prior developments in agriculture to the topic of population growth in Europe in the 1700s.) • “In Europe, the period of 1700 to 1800 was characterized by rapid industrialization all over the continent. This industrialization led to the establishment of factories and mass production, which, coupled with population, brought tons of people to urban centers and led to the development of cities. The move to cities had extremely significant effects on the lives of Europeans.” (The response relates a prior demographic development to the topic of population growth in Europe in the 1700s.) Note: In order to earn this point the response should clearly connect the relevant contextual information to the topic. A mere passing reference to another event or time period does not suffice for this point. Examples of unacceptable contextualization: • “During the eighteenth to nineteenth century in Europe, the continent was prospering because of the industrial revolution. This revolution allowed the work that was once done by hand to be done by machines. This meant that once cumbersome jobs became much easier. Farming became more efficient and goods were able to be mass produced much more easily. In the advent of the Industrial Revolution, people began to migrate to Europe in order to seek better jobs and a more stable lifestyle.” (While the response refers to potentially relevant context about industrialization and demographic shifts, it does not link any of these historical developments to population growth in the 1700s.) • “Population growth, and the expansion of nations, during the 18th and 19th centuries is what truly pushed the Europe toward the modern era. Before the industrialization and urbanization that happened during that period, life, for most, was about survival.” (While the response refers to potentially relevant context about quotidian life before the Industrial Revolution, it does not link this to population growth in the 1700s.) C. Evidence (0–2 points) Evidence Responses earn 1 point by providing at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt. Responses can earn this point without earning the point for a thesis statement. To earn this point the response must identify specific historical examples of evidence relevant to the topic of population growth in Europe within the period 1700–1800. These examples of evidence must be different from the information used to earn the point for contextualization. Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence will typically be more specific information. Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) Examples of evidence used might include: • Urbanization • Enclosure • Demographic shifts • Public health • Political turmoil • European marriage pattern • Class consciousness Examples of successful use of evidence: • “The problem of famine in 18th Century occured because the food supply could not keep up with population growth.” (Response provides accurate evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt.) • “Industrialization caused by the growth created a much more wealthy and prominent middle class, one which would aid the economy greatly as consumerism rose due to the large output of goods.” (Response provides accurate evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt.) Note: These statements could be credited as evidence supporting an argument if their placement in the essay or additional connective language made it clear that they were being offered in support of a particular point. OR Supports an Argument Responses earn 2 points if they support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant examples of evidence. To earn the second point, the response must use specific historical evidence to support an argument regarding population growth in Europe within the period 1700–1800. Examples of successfully supporting an argument with evidence: • “Population grew as the industrial revolution emerged and with the surge in population, the capitalistic world of trade & economy seemed to grow. The growth of the population led to more industries and more consumer goods. Factories mass-produced products which decreased the products value and allowed less wealthier people (to) buy it without spending their life savings.” (Response successfully uses evidence to support an argument linking population growth to consumerism and capitalism.) • “In addition, factories were unsanitary and lacked safety measures for workers, meaning countless died from working in the dangerous working conditions. This led to the emergence of labor unions and ultimately political acts after 1800 such as the Factory Acts in England in the early 1800s.” (Response successfully uses evidence to support an argument.) D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points) Historical Reasoning Responses earn 1 point by using historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument concerning the most significant effect of population growth in Europe within the period 1700–1800. To earn this point the response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument, although the reasoning might be uneven, imbalanced, or inconsistent. Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) Examples of using historical reasoning skills: • Establishes a causal relationship between population growth and an effect of that growth and follows through on that relationship in a coherent argument. For example, a response may point to the causal relationship between the Enclosure Act and rural unemployment which, in turn, spurred migration to industrializing cities where jobs were abundant, and which led to stronger economies. • Gives a broad category of effects of population growth and then develops subcategories/examples in order to support a broader argument. For example, a response that identifies urbanization as the most significant effect of population growth may develop an argument about how that population-growthfueled urbanization led to concerns over wages, social mobilization, and political parties. • Describes change over time, elaborating on the changes and continuities that occurred over the period covered by the topic of the prompt. For example, a response may develop the claim that stresses familial continuity despite significant changes over time, such as the deterioration of living conditions and outbreaks of disease. • This use of historical reasoning may be found within a well-crafted paragraph or part of a response that otherwise lacks organization. OR Complexity Responses earn 2 points by demonstrating a complex understanding of the effects of population growth in Europe within the period 1700–1800. Demonstrating complex understanding might include: • Analyzing the nuance of an issue by explaining the most significant effect of population growth, and noting that other effects were also significant and interrelated • Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes • Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering evidence that supports an alternate position • Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time by discussing population shifts in other periods • Explaining how different countries underwent different changes as a result of population growth, or had differing levels of growth Note: This demonstration of complex understanding must be part of an argument, not merely a phrase or reference. Complexity should emerge from the essay’s argumentation and use of evidence, and while it does not have to be present throughout the essay, the complexity point should consist of substantial elaboration. Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) Examples demonstrating complexity: • The response analyzes the nuance of 18th-century population growth by explaining that while urbanization was its most significant effect, other effects such as the privileging of leisure, a new consumer economy, and a change to gender roles were also significant and interrelated. • The response confirms the validity of the argument that sociopolitical development was the most significant effect of 18th-century population growth by supporting the claim with variegated but linked discussions of industrialization, including the defining of the modern class system and the creation of the new consumer culture of the late 17th century. • The response explains how different countries or European regions underwent different changes as a result of population growth, or had differing levels of growth. For example, the response juxtaposes Great Britain’s ability to meet the demand of its growing population through increased industrial production with Ireland’s inability to industrialize fast enough to meet the demand of its growing population, resulting in the Irish potato famine. • The response qualifies or modifies the argument that both the demand for and supply of new products and materials was the most significant effect of 18th-century population growth by considering evidence that supports an alternate position: that there were negative impacts of population growth such as public health problems, women forced into prostitution, and artisans displaced by industrialization. Question 4 — Long Essay Question “Evaluate the most significant effect of the Great Depression in Europe during the period 1929–1950.” Maximum Possible Points: 6 Points  Rubric  Notes  A: Thesis/Claim (0–1)  Thesis/Claim: Responds to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis/claim that establishes a line of reasoning. (1 point) To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt, rather than merely restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion.  The thesis statement must make a historically defensible claim about the most significant effect of the Great Depression in Europe during the period 1929–1950, with some indication of the reasoning for making that claim. • “Although most countries recovered from the effects of the Great Depression, the most significant effect included the economic devastations countries faced because it damaged the living conditions and caused political unrest, leading to World War Two.” • “The most significant effect of the Great  Depression in Europe from 1929 to 1950 was causing rising political extremism due to uncertain circumstances in the lives of all Europeans, and especially embracing larger governments and more government controlled economies.”  B: Contextualization(0–1)  Contextualization: Describes a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. (1 point) To earn this point, the response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that occur before, during, or continue after the time frame of the question. This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or a reference.  To earn this point, the essay must accurately describe a context relevant to the Great Depression in Europe during the period 1929– 1950. Examples of context might discuss the following topics, with appropriate elaboration: • World War I (in general) • Treaty of Versailles/German reparations • Weimar Republic (weakness/instability) • United States loans and investments in Europe (Dawes/Young Plan) • 1929 stock market crash  • Age of Anxiety/Roaring 20s • New Deal/U.S. policies and other responses to the Great Depression • League of Nations (weakness of) • Pre-1929 Hitler/Nazi Party/Mein Kampf  Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) C: Evidence(0–2)  Evidence: Provides specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt. (1 point) OR Supports an Argument: Supports an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant examples of evidence. (2 points)  To earn the first point, the response must identify specific historical examples of evidence relevant to the Great Depression in Europe during the period 1929–1950. OR To earn the second point, the response must use specific historical evidence to support an argument in response to the prompt. Evidence used might include: • Hitler’s rise to power (legal means/Reichstag fire/Enabling Act) • World War II and Holocaust • Mussolini and Fascist Italy’s policies post  1929 • Communism as alternative to capitalism in Germany • Creation of the welfare state and various welfare state policies • Stalin’s Five-Year Plan • Appeasement policy as a consequence of the Great Depression • Various anti-Semitic policies such as the Nuremberg Laws  D: Analysis and Reasoning(0–2)  Historical Reasoning: Uses historical reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, continuity, and change over time) to frame or structure an argument that addresses the prompt. (1 point) To earn the first point, the response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument about the effects of the Great Depression in Europe, although the reasoning might be uneven, imbalanced, or inconsistent.  Examples of using historical reasoning might include: • Establishing a causal relationship between the Great Depression and an effect of the Depression, such as the rise of Hitler or the creation of the welfare state, and explaining the connections between the cause and the effect • Identifying a general effect of the Depression, such as political radicalization, and then discussing examples, such as Nazism in Germany or fascism in Italy, compared with more interventionist governments in Great Britain and France, in order to support a broader argument  regarding the most significant effect • Describing continuity or change over time, by arguing that Germany was economically suffering from World War I but that this was intensified by the Great Depression  Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) OR  OR  Complexity: Demonstrates a complex understanding of the historical development that is the focus of prompt, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the prompt. (2 points) To earn the second point, the response must demonstrate a complex understanding of the effects of the Great Depression.  Demonstrating complex understanding might include: • Explaining the most significant effect of the Great Depression, such as the rise of Hitler or World War II, while noting that other effects such as increased government intervention were also significant and interrelated • Explaining how multiple countries underwent different changes or were variously impacted as a result of the Depression • Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time by discussing economic crises in other periods, such as the 2008 Great Recession or the financial crises of the 20th century • Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering evidence that supports an alternate position, such as suggesting that fascism would have developed independently as a result of German dissatisfaction with the Treaty of Versailles • Developing an extended analysis of various economic systems and theories, such as laissez-faire capitalism or the Soviet command economy This demonstration of complex understanding must be part of an argument, not merely a phrase or reference. Complexity should emerge from the essay’s argumentation and use of evidence, and while it does not have to be present throughout the essay, the complexity point should consist of substantial elaboration.  If response is completely blank, enter --for all four score categories: A, B, C, and D.  Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) Scoring Notes Introductory notes: • Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a student could earn a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim. • Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, responses may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. • Clarity: Exam responses should be considered first drafts, and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 point) Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim about the most significant effect of the Great Depression in Europe during the period 1929–1950, with some indication of the reasoning for making that claim. Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion, which does not have to be contained in the first or last paragraph. The thesis is not required to encompass the entirety of the period, but it must identify a relevant development or developments within the period. Examples of acceptable theses: • “The Great Depression lead to the suffering of people, and therefore became the jump spring for extreme ideologies. The most significant effect of the Great Depression is aiding the growth of nationalism in Germany and further leading to the World War II.” (The response makes a clear and historically defensible claim that the Great Depression led to enormous suffering, while also establishing a line of reasoning that this resulted in the rise of nationalism and thus World War II.) • “The most significant effect of the Great Depression from 1929 to 1950 was World War II as the Great Depression created the conditions for fascist dictators like Mussilini (Il Duce) and Hitler (Furer) to rise to power.” (The response clearly identifies the most significant effect of the Great Depression as World War II, which was made possible by the rise of authoritarian leaders after 1929, thus demonstrating an explicit line of reasoning.) Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) Examples of unacceptable theses: • “The most significant effect of the Great Depression in Europe was the inflation rate and how poorly it caused the economy to become.” (This response makes a evaluative claim that the most significant effect of the Great Depression was inflation and a poor economy, but this is cyclical and descriptive.) • “The Great Depression brought along several negative factors such as economical problems, famine, a limitation in resources, and finally a decrease in population.” (Although this response makes a potentially historically defensible claim, it does not offer an evaluative component specifying which effect is most significant.) B. Contextualization (0–1 point) Responses earn 1 point by describing a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. To earn this point the response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that occurred before or during or continued after the time frame of 1929 to 1950. This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or a reference. To earn the point the essay must accurately describe a context relevant to the effects of the Great Depression in the period from 1929 to 1950. Examples might include the following, with appropriate elaboration: • World War I (in general) • Treaty of Versailles/German reparations • Weimar Republic (weakness/instability) • United States loans and investments in Europe (Dawes/Young Plan) • 1929 stock market crash • Age of Anxiety/Roaring 20s • New Deal/U.S. policies and other responses to the Great Depression • League of Nations (weakness of) • Pre-1929 Hitler/Nazi Party/Mein Kampf Examples of acceptable contextualization: • “World War I left Europe in tatters geographically, socially, and economically. The combination of new military techniques and Napoleonic tactics led to devastating losses, and the war guilt clause put a tremendous economic burden on Germany, which would plunge it into destitution that would only deepen with Global downturn of the economy in the Great Depression.” (The response begins by describing a broader historical context relevant to the prompt by discussing the impact of World War I on Europe and the consequences of the Treaty of Versailles especially.) • “Europe prior to the Great Depression of 1929 was left in ruins after the carnage of First World War. The war had sapped the economies of Europe, and left economic turmoil in their wake. The Treaty of Versailles left the fledgling Weimar Republic crippled. The Great Depression served to further exacerbate such problems.” (By connecting the Great Depression to the devastation of World War I, the Treaty of Versailles, and the Weimar Republic, the response describes a broader historical context to the prompt.) Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) • “The Great Depression hit Europe during the Interwar Years following the US Great Depression. When the US pulled out of European stocks it put Europe in a tight spot where inflation occurred and widespread Depression struck Europe.” (The response provides a broader historical context by describing the connections between developments in Europe and the United States.) Note: In order to earn this point the response should clearly connect the relevant contextual information to the topic. A mere passing reference to another event or time period does not suffice for this point. Examples of unacceptable contextualization: • “Post World War I Europe was a testament to human destruction, both economic, human, and landscape. A Great Depressions wrecked the continent from 1929-1950 creating political turbulence in many nations.” (The response attempts to provide immediate context by referencing the devastation seen in Europe after 1918; however, this is not developed and is a passing reference.) • “The Great Depression was a worldwide effect that had detrimental repercussions all over. It caused a lack of money throughout the world, and in turn, caused many people to not have bare necessities.” (The response describes the impact of the Great Depression in generalized terms but does not provide a specific discussion of developments in Europe.) C. Evidence (0–2 points) Evidence Responses earn 1 point by providing at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt. Responses can earn this point without earning the point for a thesis statement. To earn this point the response must identify specific historical examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the effects of the Great Depression in the period from 1929 to 1950. These examples of evidence must be different from the information used to earn the point for contextualization. Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument, or a significant portion of it, in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence will typically be more specific information. Examples of evidence used might include: • Hitler’s rise to power (legal means/Reichstag fire/Enabling Act) • World War II and Holocaust • Mussolini and Fascist Italy’s policies post 1929 • Communism as alternative to capitalism in Germany • Creation of the welfare state and various welfare state policies • Stalin’s Five-Year Plan • Appeasement policy as a consequence of the Great Depression • Various anti-Semitic policies such as the Nuremberg Laws Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) Examples of successful use of evidence: • “He [Hitler] also was responsible for the mass killings of European Jews in concentration camps such as Aushwitz and massacres, with estimate of 6 million victims, and many more displaced during the Holocaust.” (Response provides accurate evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt.) • “The invasion of Poland in 1939 marked the beginning of WW2.” (Response provides one piece of accurate evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt.) Note: These statements could be credited as evidence supporting an argument if their placement in the essay or additional connective language made it clear that they were being offered in support of a particular point. OR Supports an Argument Responses earn 2 points if they support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant examples of evidence. To earn the second point, the response must use specific historical evidence to support an argument regarding the effects of the Great Depression in the period from 1929 to 1950. Examples of successfully supporting an argument with evidence: • “After the first World War, victorious powers crippled the German economy with harsh reparations and land seizures, inevitably make Germany more susceptible to the Great Depression. With unemployment at record highs, the German people were demoralized and highly receptive to the nationalist sentiments of Hitler’s Nazi campaign. Once Hitler took power, he increased industrial production and dropped unemployment rates, which caused him to be heavily supported by the German people.” (The response clearly connects Germany’s economic burdens from World War I and the Great Depression to an argument about Hitler’s political messaging and rise to power.) • “Throughout Europe and the world, the influence of government in the economy increased as more countries began to apply Keysian economics. This model, developed by Keynes, said that governments ought to borrow money and support works that would help the economy recover during depressions. The British added support to their economy by adding cradle to grave insurance. This stabilized the economy and allowed for greater spending because less money needed to be saved for health care by citizens. It also increased the influence of parliament in healthcare.” (This response uses multiple examples in order to a support an argument that British thinkers and politicians implemented interventionist policies in response to the Great Depression.) D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points) Historical Reasoning Responses earn 1 point by using historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument concerning the most significant effect of the Great Depression in the period from 1929 to 1950. To earn this point, the response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument, although the reasoning might be uneven, imbalanced, or inconsistent. Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) Examples of using historical reasoning skills: • Establishing a causal relationship between the Great Depression and an effect of the Depression, such as the rise of Hitler or the creation of the welfare state, and explaining the connections between the cause and the effect • Identifying a general effect of the Depression, such as political radicalization, and then discussing examples, such as Nazism in Germany or fascism in Italy compared with more interventionist governments in Great Britain and France, in order to support a broader argument regarding the most significant effect • Describing continuity or change over time, by arguing that Germany was economically suffering from World War I but that this was intensified by the Great Depression OR Complexity Responses earn 2 points by demonstrating a complex understanding of the effects of the Great Depression in the period from 1929 to 1950. Demonstrating complex understanding might include: • Explaining the most significant effect of the Great Depression, such as the rise of Hitler or World War II, while noting that other effects such as increased government intervention were also significant and interrelated • Explaining how multiple countries underwent different changes or were variously impacted as a result of the Depression • Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time by discussing economic crises in other periods, such as the 2008 Great Recession or the financial crises of the 20th century • Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering evidence that supports an alternate position, such as suggesting that fascism would have developed independently as a result of German dissatisfaction with the Treaty of Versailles • Developing an extended analysis of various economic systems and theories, such as laissez-faire capitalism or the Soviet command economy Note: This demonstration of complex understanding must be part of an argument, not merely a phrase or reference. Complexity should emerge from the essay’s argumentation and use of evidence, and while it does not have to be present throughout the essay, the complexity point should consist of substantial elaboration. Examples demonstrating complexity: • The response draws insightful connections across time periods by comparing nationalism that developed in Germany in response to the Treaty of Versailles with nationalism fostered by Bismarck as a part of his Realpolitik policy, and more broadly, the role nationalism had in sparking governmental change. • The response develops a nuanced and extended analysis of the changes in economic theory and application by governments following the onset of the Great Depression. It specifically addresses the loss of faith in laissez-faire economics, a new interest in Keynesian economics, and various implementations thereof.
