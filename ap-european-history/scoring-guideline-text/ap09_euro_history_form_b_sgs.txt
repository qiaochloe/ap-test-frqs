Provides an appropriate, explicitly stated thesis that directly addresses all parts of the question. Thesis must not simply restate the question. The thesis must make some effort to address both causes and responses with some degree of specificity (beyond general analytical categories). The thesis must suggest a minimal level of analysis or context drawn from the documents, though a student does not necessarily need to use both the terms “causes” and “responses” explicitly. The complete thesis need not appear in the first paragraph. 2. Discusses a majority of the documents individually and specifically. The student must use at least seven documents—even if used incorrectly—by reference to anything in the box. Documents need not be cited by number or by name as long as the student makes clear which source is being referenced. 3. Demonstrates understanding of the basic meaning of a majority of the documents (may misinterpret no more than one). A student may not significantly misinterpret more than one document. A major misinterpretation is an incorrect analysis or one that leads to an inaccurate grouping or a false conclusion.  4. Supports the thesis with appropriate interpretations of a majority of the documents. The student must use at least seven documents correctly, and the documents used in the body of the essay must provide support for the thesis. A student cannot earn this point if no credit was awarded for point 1 (appropriate thesis). 5. Analyzes point of view or bias in at least three documents. The student must make a reasonable effort to explain why a particular source expresses the stated view by: 1. Relating authorial point of view to author’s place in society (motive, position, status, etc.) OR 2. Evaluating the reliability of the source OR 3. Recognizing that different kinds of documents serve different purposes OR 4. Analyzing the tone of the documents; must be well-developed Note: 1) Attribution alone is not sufficient to earn credit for point of view. 2) It is possible for students to discuss point of view collectively, but this counts for only one point of view. 6. Analyzes documents by explicitly organizing them in at least three appropriate groups. A group must contain at least two documents that are used correctly and individually. Expanded Core: 0–3 points to a total of 9 points Expands beyond the basic core of 1–6. The basic score of 6 must be achieved before a student can earn expanded core points. Credit awarded in the expanded core should be based on holistic assessment of the essay. Factors to consider in holistic assessment may include: • Has a clear, analytical, and comprehensive thesis • Uses all or almost all of the documents (11–12 documents) • Uses the documents persuasively as evidence • Shows understanding of nuances of the documents • Analyzes point of view or bias in at least four documents cited in the essay • Analyzes the documents in additional ways (e.g., develops more groupings) • Brings in relevant “outside” information Document 1: Chart, “French University Enrollment, 1945–1968.” Shows rapid university enrollment increase (from circa 125,000 students in 1945 to circa 550,000 students in 1968). Document 2: Georges Marchais, leader of the French Communist Party, L’Humanité, Communist Party newspaper, May 3, 1968. In Communist Party newspaper L’Humanité, Marchais says that “pseudo-revolutionary groups” are leading demonstrations of workers and students and detracting from the goals of the French Communist Party. Document 3: Geneviève Schweitzer, reporter for the conservative newspaper Le Figaro, May 5, 1968. Causes of “exasperation” and demonstrations is “anxiety” students feel “about their future” because of “overflow of students” in the university and because education is irrelevant to the values of contemporary society. Document 4: Workers’ solidarity pamphlet #39, date unknown. Unemployment is high; many workers remain poorly paid despite the rise of real wages; trade union membership is down (to 3 million people compared with 7 million people in 1945); large manufacturers are able to ignore unions. Document 5: Cartoon, Leftist publication, May 1968. Shows students overturning traditional France (Liberty, judge, military, police, priest, communist) while riot police flee. Placards read “Riot Police are Nazis,” “Examinations are Repressive,” and “Solidarity with Workers.” Document 6: Janet Flanner, foreign correspondent, “Paris Journal,” The New Yorker, May 9, 1968. Sorbonne closed down, unarmed and lightly armed students began “roaming the streets” and building barricades, coming into conflict with more heavily armed riot police. Police used tear gas, students threw Molotov cocktails, and cars were set on fire. Document 7: Student slogans shouted in street demonstrations, May 1968. “Professors, you and your culture are outdated.” “We refuse to be the future cadre of capitalist exploiters.” “De Gaulle, assassin!” “De Gaulle, resignation!” Document 8: Edgar Morin, sociologist, in the politically moderate newspaper Le Monde, May 22, 1968. Communist Party reformism meets needs of many workers, but not young workers. Students and workers in revitalized “extreme leftist movements” take out anger on the Communist Party. Document 9: Poster created by the Atelier populaire (People’s Workshop), a left-wing student group, May 1968. “Factories, Universities, Union.” Question 1—Document Summary (continued) Document 10: Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, editor of the weekly newsmagazine L’Express, May 31, 1968. The anti-Gaullist editor welcomes riots, which are caused by “the rapid acceleration of intellectual change” and “rigidity of traditional structures.” Structures are most rigid in France because under Gaullism “[t]here was no dialogue between unions and industry, between industry and executive powers.” Document 11: President de Gaulle, television speech to supporters immediately following the Gaullist election victory, June 7, 1968. France is threatened by dictatorship of communists, but “[p]rogress, independence, and peace will prevail along with liberty. Vive la France!” Document 12: President de Gaulle, interview on French national television following the Gaullist election victory, June 11, 1968. Students’ anguish is natural, understandable in “modern, mechanized consumer society.” They lack an ideal and are thus misled by groups that have no better plan but “delight in negation, destruction, violence, and anarchy. . . .” Evaluate the changes and continuities in women’s public roles during the Renaissance. 9–8 Points • Thesis is explicit and fully responsive to the question. • Organization is clear, consistently followed, and effective in support of the argument. o Essay must explicitly evaluate the changes AND continuities in women’s public roles during the Renaissance. o Response is in the proper chronological context of the Italian and/or Northern Renaissance and may include evidence from the fourteenth to the end of the sixteenth centuries. • Essay is well balanced;
