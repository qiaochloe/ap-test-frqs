Has an acceptable thesis. Thesis must be explicit, based on one or more documents.  It may not be a simple rewording of the question or of the historical background. Thesis need not appear in the first paragraph.  2. Uses a majority of documents. Uses at least 6 documents by reference to anything in the box. [The maps are a document];  The documents need not be cited by number or name. 3. Supports thesis or answers question with appropriate evidence from at least one document. Even when there is no thesis, the essay can still offer evidence from the documents relating to growth of Manchester and reactions to it, earning a point. 4. Understands the basic meaning of the documents cited in the essay. Must use at least four documents correctly.  May make a major misinterpretation of no more than one document; a major misinterpretation is one that leads to an inaccurate grouping or a false analysis.  Two “almost major errors” = one major error.  Errors in attempts to use POV should not be judged as severely. 5. Analyzes bias or point of view in at least two documents. Relates authorial point of view to author’s place OR Evaluates the reliability of the source OR Recognizes that different kinds of documents serve different purposes OR Analyzes tone or intent of documents  OR analyzes POV or bias in one document well and gives consistent attribution. 6. Analyzes documents by grouping them in at least two groups. A group must have at least 2 docs.  A fallacious grouping receives no credit.   Examples of possible groups: Con 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11 Pro 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11 Reformers  6, 7, 8 Foreign observers  5, 7 Poets 2, 4 Economic concerns  3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11 Political concerns 4, 10 Health concerns  1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 Moral concerns 2, 6, 7 Working conditions  1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11 Aesthetic concerns  1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11 Living conditions  1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11 POV: government and business observers, reformers, foreigners EXPANDED CORE: 0-3  points to a total of 9 points Must earn 6 points in the basic core before earning points in the expanded core.

Analysis of the links may be uneven; may discuss only a few developments in considerable depth or several developments adequately. Discussion of political (dictatorships) or economic (the Great Depression) developments is acceptable provided they are linked to developments in culture and society. Essay may differentiate between culture and society or may conflate the two. • Provides specific evidence for the developments or may analyze strongly in more conceptual terms. Chronological focus may be uneven, but primary focus is on the interwar period. Material from the prewar era or post-1939 period is acceptable, provided it is linked to interwar developments in culture and society. 5-4 Mixed Essays 1. Contains thesis, perhaps superficial or simplistic  2. Responds to question unevenly: task(s), evidence, chronology 3. May contain errors, factual or interpretive • Thesis may be superficial, simplistic or imprecise- may just refer to “devastating,” “positive/negative,” “major” impact. • Links between WWI and interwar culture and society may be minimal or have to be inferred by the reader-perhaps no more than a reference to devastation. At times may even emphasize other events (the Great Depression.) Links between political (dictatorships) or economic (the Great Depression) developments and interwar culture and society may be vague or not extensively developed. • Evidence provided may be of a rather general nature (e.g., references to writers and artists but no specific relevant examples.) • Chronological focus may be patchy- may wander out of the interwar period considerably. 3-2-1-0 Weaker Essays 1. Thesis confused, unfocused, or absent, or simply restates the question.  2. Misconstrues the question or omits major tasks. 3. May contain major errors. • Thesis confused, unfocused, or absent, or may simply restate the question. • Offers no link between WWI and interwar culture and society. Political (dictatorships) or economic (the Great Depression) developments are not linked to interwar culture and society. • Touches briefly upon potentially relevant subjects but fails either to develop them or to link them to the concerns of the question, or both. • May misconstrue the question- may, for example, discuss interwar diplomacy, the rise of Hitler, or the coming of World War II. • Commits major interpretive or factual errors. 9-8-7-6 Stronger Essays These essays will demonstrate the following qualities with varying degrees of effectiveness: • Thesis addresses terms of question • Addresses the terms of the question:  tasks, content, chronology— perhaps with some unevenness • Well organized • Stronger essays may contain minor errors; even a “9” need not be flawless Indicators: 9-8 1. Thesis delineates the nature of absolutism’s effect on nobility 2. Details change in monarch/nobility relationships Indicators: 7-6 1. Essay rises above narrative on absolutism 2. Analyzes status and power effects in at least 2 countries 5 - 4 Mixed Essays (These scores should be used judiciously) • Contains a thesis, perhaps superficial or simplistic • Addresses the terms of the question unevenly: tasks, evidence, chronology • Uneven organization • May contain errors, factual and/or interpretive Indicators: 5-4 1. Thesis notes existence of effects, without much interpretation 2. Examples from at least 2 countries drawn essentially from the 1650-1750 period 3. Occasional confusion of nobles with other groups 4. Status and power are addressed, perhaps in a superficial or implicit manner 5. Appropriate examples drawn from two countries, perhaps more from one Question 5 (cont’d.) 3-2-1-0 Weaker Essays Essays in this category will demonstrate the following qualities in varying degrees.
