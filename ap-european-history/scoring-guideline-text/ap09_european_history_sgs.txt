Provides an appropriate, explicitly stated thesis that directly addresses all parts of the question. Thesis must not simply restate the question. The thesis must address both attitudes and motives, and with some degree of specificity (beyond general analytical categories) for at least one part of the prompt. The thesis must suggest a minimal level of analysis drawn from the context of the documents, though a student does not necessarily need to use both the terms “attitudes” and “motivations” explicitly. The thesis may appear in the final paragraph. 2. Discusses a majority of the documents individually and specifically. The student must use at least seven documents—even if used incorrectly—by reference to anything in the box. Documents cannot be referenced collectively in order to get credit for this point (e.g., “Documents 1, 4, and 6 suggest . . .”) unless the student goes on to discuss them individually. Documents need not be cited by number or by name. 3. Demonstrates understanding of the basic meaning of a majority of the documents (may misinterpret no more than one). A student may not significantly misinterpret more than one document. A major misinterpretation is an incorrect analysis or one that leads to an inaccurate grouping or a false conclusion.  4. Supports the thesis with appropriate interpretations of a majority of the documents. The student must use at least seven documents correctly, and the documents used in the body of the essay must provide support for the thesis. A student cannot earn this point if no credit was awarded for point 1 (appropriate thesis). 5. Analyzes point of view or bias in at least three documents. The student must make a reasonable effort to explain why a particular source expresses the stated view by: • Relating authorial point of view to author’s place in society (motive, position, status, etc.) OR • Evaluating the reliability of the source OR • Recognizing that different kinds of documents serve different purposes OR • Analyzing the tone of the documents; must be well developed Note: 1) Attribution alone is not sufficient to earn credit for point of view. 2) It is possible for students to discuss point of view collectively, but this counts for only one point of view. Question 1—Document-Based Question (continued) 6. Analyzes documents by explicitly organizing them in at least three appropriate groups. A group must contain at least two documents that are used correctly and individually. Groupings and corresponding documents may include the following (not exclusive): Attitudes Pro-imperialist: • Economic: 1, 4, 5, 11 • Nationalistic: 1, 2, 8, 10, 12 • Social/Cultural: 1, 5, 8, 11 Anti-imperialist: 3, 6, 7, 9 • Economic: 7, 9 • Social/Cultural/Humanitarian: 6, 9 Motivations Economic • Expansion and prosperity: 1, 4, 5, 11 • Capitalism: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11  • Markets and trade: 4, 9 • Acquisition of raw materials: 1, 11 Political • Nationalism: 1, 2, 10, 12 • Global power politics: 1, 2, 8, 10 • Regaining national glory (France): 10, 11, 12 • Maintaining and building empire (Britain): 2, 4, 5, 8 Social/Cultural/Humanitarian • Social Darwinism: 6, 8, 11 • “White Man’s Burden”: 1, 5, 11 Exploitation: 6, 9 Expanded Core: 0–3 points to a total of 9 points Expands beyond the basic core of 1–6. The basic score of 6 must be achieved before a student can earn expanded core points. Credit awarded in the expanded core should be based on holistic assessment of the essay. Factors to consider in holistic assessment may include: • Has a clear, analytical, and comprehensive thesis • Uses all or almost all of the documents (11–12 documents) • Uses the documents persuasively as evidence • Shows understanding of nuances of the documents • Analyzes point of view or bias in at least four documents cited in the essay • Analyzes the documents in additional ways (e.g., develops more groupings) • Recognizes and develops change over time • Brings in relevant “outside” information Question 1—Document-Based Question (continued) A CLOSER LOOK AT POINT OF VIEW IN THE 2009 DBQ There are many means by which a student can demonstrate point-of-view analysis in the 2009 DBQ. Students must make a reasonable effort to address point of view by referring to at least three documents.  Examples of ACCEPTABLE point-of-view analysis Relating authorial point of view to author’s place in society: “As heir to the Belgian throne, it is not surprising that Prince Leopold supported imperialism since he wanted to increase the power and prestige of the country he would one day rule (doc. 1).” “Since Joseph Chamberlain was a British industrialist, he naturally supported imperialism since he probably stood to gain economically from the continued growth of the British Empire (doc. 4).” Evaluating the reliability of the source: “The resolution from the German Social Democratic Party Congress is probably a biased source since as socialists they would naturally condemn a capitalist agenda (doc. 9).” “Merlin is a governor general of a colony so his pro-imperialist point of view is not surprising since his job was dependent upon the success of French imperialism.” Recognizing that different kinds of documents serve different purposes: “Since Benjamin Disraeli was delivering a speech to the House of Commons, he probably chose his words carefully to persuade members to support his political agenda (doc. 2).” “Lord Rosebery was writing a letter to a newspaper, which was clearly a public forum; therefore, this document could be viewed as a form of propaganda (doc. 8).” Analyzing the tone of the documents: “Because Bismarck was most concerned with power politics on the European continent, his comments regarding imperialism seem somewhat satirical (doc. 3).” Examples of UNACCEPTABLE point-of-view analysis “Louis Bernard was a French colonial official who, in his memoir, stated that he felt France got over its humiliation by conquering Algeria (doc. 12).” Why is this unacceptable? This is merely attribution with no attempt at further analysis beyond the stated information from the document itself; the statement does not explain why Bernard held these views. “Bernard was writing in a memoir so it is objective (doc. 12).” Why is this unacceptable? Again, this is really just attribution, since the statement makes no effort to explain how or why a memoir would be an objective source. “Since Benjamin Disraeli is a politician, he must be biased (doc. 2).” Why is this unacceptable? This statement merely asserts that Disraeli is biased with no attempt to explain why he may hold a biased view. “Since Archibald Philip Primrose is writing a letter, he is being honest (doc. 8).” Why is this unacceptable? This statement fails to account for the fact that Primrose is writing a letter for a newspaper, which is a very public document, not a private correspondence. © 2009 The College Board.

[T]he globe may become the field of our operations and our resources. . . . [C]olonies are useful” since “they play a great part in that which makes up the power and prosperity of states. . . . [L]et us see where there are unoccupied lands . . . to prove to the world that Belgians also are an imperial people capable of dominating and enlightening others.” Document 2: Benjamin Disraeli, British prime minister, speech to the House of Commons regarding the Suez Canal, February 1876. “I do not recommend . . . this purchase [of the Suez Canal] . . . as a financial investment or as a commercial speculation. I . . . recommend it . . . as a political transaction . . . to strengthen the empire.” Document 3: Chancellor Otto von Bismarck of Germany, speaking to a countryman back from exploring Africa, 1888. “Your map of Africa is very nice, but my map of Africa is in Europe . . . and we are in the middle. That is my map of Africa.” Document 4: Joseph Chamberlain, British industrialist, politician, and reformer, speech, 1888. We have suffered much from depression of trade and many are unemployed. “Is there any man in his senses who believes” we “could exist . . . if we were to be cut adrift from the great dependencies which now look to us for protection and which are natural markets for our trade?” If we reduced our empire to the United Kingdom, “half . . . our population would be starved.” Document 5: Cecil Rhodes, British imperialist, speech at the chartering of the British South Africa Company, 1889. “Philanthropy is good, but philanthropy at 5 percent is even better.” Document 6: George Washington Williams, Baptist minister, lawyer, historian, and legislator, “An Open Letter to His Serene Majesty, Leopold II, King of the Belgians and Sovereign of the Independent State of Congo,” Stanley Falls, Congo Free State, 1890. Mr. Henry Stanley and several Zanzibar soldiers used “carefully rehearsed . . . sleight of hand tricks” when making treaties with the native chiefs of the Independent State of the Congo. “By such means as these, and a few boxes of gin, whole villages have been signed away to Your Majesty.” Document 7: William Clark, “The Genesis of Jingoism,” Progressive Review, London, 1897. “Although in its essence capitalism is international, . . . for the present it is accustomed to find in exaggerated forms of nationalism its most potent ally. The music hall patriot is encouraged to howl for Jameson or any other hero of the hour” when he is really “howling for the financiers who are making Jameson their tool.” Document 8: Archibald Philip Primrose, Lord Rosebery, British politician and foreign secretary, letter to the London Times, 1900. “An Empire such as ours requires as its first condition an imperial race—a race vigorous and industrious and intrepid. . . . [S]urvival of the fittest is an absolute truth in the conditions of the modern world.” Question 1—Document Summary (continued) Document 9: Resolution of the German Social Democratic Party Congress, 1900. “World and colonial” power “is pursued for . . . capitalist exploitation and for displaying military force . . . [I]t corresponds to the greedy desire of the bourgeoisie . . . to invest its ever-increasing capital . . . and to the desire for new markets which each country tries to usurp to itself.” Document 10: Eugène-Melchior de Vogüé, French diplomat, The Master of the Sea, Paris, 1903. “Diplomacy used to be concerned with the Mediterranean and the Bosporus. . . . [G]reat states of Europe are [now] dividing up . . . Africa and Asia. . . . What used to be a European balance of power is now a world balance of power, . . . and any country that does not wish to become less important must obtain as much new territory relatively as our rivals are doing.” Document 11: Martial Henri Merlin, governor general of French Equatorial Africa, speech, 1910. “We went to new territories . . . by virtue of the right of a civilized . . . race to occupy territories . . . left fallow by backward peoples who are plunged into barbarism and unable to develop the wealth of their land. What we exercised is a right. . . . We are entitled to . . . occupy their territories,” but we “are also charged with a duty toward these peoples . . . [which] we must never . . . forget.” Document 12: Louis Bernard, French colonial official, memoir, Paris, 1936. “I found [in Algeria before the First World War] . . . a victorious and conquering France, which allowed me to forget the humiliated France on the other side of the water. I was in a country of empire . . . in which I participated instead of submitting, as it was in our annexed provinces, Alsace and Lorraine.” Question 2 Analyze the long-term and short-term factors responsible for the disintegration of communist rule in TWO of the following states: Czechoslovakia East Germany Hungary Poland 9–8 Points • Thesis explicitly identifies long-term and short-term factors responsible for the disintegration of communist rule in two states. • Organization is clear, consistently followed, and effective in support of the argument. • Essay is well balanced; long-term and short-term factors responsible for the disintegration of communist rule in two states are covered at some length. • Major assertions in the essay are supported thoroughly and consistently by relevant evidence. • May contain errors that do not detract from the argument. 7–6 Points • Thesis identifies long-term and short-term factors responsible for the disintegration of communist rule in two states but may not be fully developed.  • Organization is clear and effective in support of the argument but may introduce evidence that is not pertinent to the task. • Essay covers all major topics suggested by the prompt but may analyze one set of factors OR one country in greater depth. • Major assertions in the essay are supported by relevant evidence. • May contain an error that detracts from the argument. 5–4 Points • Thesis identifies factors responsible for the disintegration of communism but may ignore the distinction between long-term factors and short-term factors. • Organization is clear but may not be consistently followed; essay may veer off task. • Essay may not complete all tasks; it may analyze only one set of factors for two countries OR may only analyze factors for one country OR may be primarily descriptive rather than analytical. • Offers supporting evidence for some of the long-term and short-term factors responsible for the disintegration of communist rule. • May contain errors that detract from the argument. 3–2 Points • Thesis may identify factors as short-term and/or long-term factors without demonstrating understanding of the two concepts OR may paraphrase the prompt. • Organization is unclear and ineffective. • Essay shows serious imbalance; treatment of short-term and long-term factors is superficial. • Offers minimal or confused evidence regarding long-term and short-term factors responsible for the disintegration of communist rule. • May contain several errors that detract from the argument. Question 2 (continued) 1–0 Points • Thesis is erroneous OR irrelevant OR absent. • No effective organization is evident. • Short-term and long-term factors are described generically or polemically. • Provides little or no relevant supporting evidence. • May contain numerous errors that detract from the argument. Question 2 Historical Background Material in this section is derived from the following texts:  Lynn Hunt, The Making of the West Since 1340—Peoples and Cultures Donald Kagan, The Western Heritage Mark Kishlansky, Civilization in the West John McKay, A History of Western Society Since 1300 R. R. Palmer, A History of the Modern World Jackson Spielvogel, Western Civilization Since 1300 1. 1945-49/late 1940s In the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin extended its authority over Eastern Europe and gradually imposed communist rule in a number of states. Possibly motivated by concerns over security and traditional Russian expansionist ambitions, Stalin imposed one-party political systems, Soviet economic policies, attacks on traditional elites like the Roman Catholic Church, and ideological indoctrination. Local communist rulers maintained control in large part due to the continued presence of the Red Army. The fate of the Central and Eastern European states became entangled in the Cold War. Germany, which had been temporarily divided among the winners after the war, witnessed a more permanent division with the creation in 1949 of West and East Germany. The latter was governed by communists selected by Stalin.  2. The 1950s The death of Stalin in 1953 and Khrushchev’s endorsement of de-Stalinization and acknowledgment of “many roads to socialism” triggered overt opposition to Soviet power in Central and Eastern Europe. Workers unsuccessfully rioted in East Berlin in 1953, but the greatest challenge to Soviet authority came in 1956 shortly after Khrushchev’s “Secret Speech” and its revelations about the crimes of Stalin. Poland and Hungary served as the focal points of protest, with the Hungarian communist leader Imre Nagy promising free elections and withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet counterpart to NATO. In the end, Soviet forces crushed the Hungarian Revolution by force, and Nagy was executed two years later. The Polish communists, while promising greater autonomy to their people, avoided Hungary’s fate by retaining a monopoly on political power and remaining members of the Warsaw Pact. 3. The 1960s The focal point of much of the Cold War was the city of Berlin. Deep inside the Soviet zone of occupation, the economic recovery and greater personal freedom offered by West Berlin led to the exodus of about three million East Germans between 1949 and 1961. The departure of so many skilled and educated workers threatened to shatter the East German economy and was a propaganda disaster for the Russians. In 1961, the Soviet and East German governments divided the city by constructing the Berlin Wall, one of the symbols of the unpopularity of communist rule in much of Central and Eastern Europe. By the late 1960s, however, the two German governments agreed to develop closer economic and diplomatic relations, a policy known as Ostpolitik. The policy promoted consumerism in the East at the expense of a growing public debt. The 1960s are often remembered as an era of failed attempts to accomplish drastic political, economic, and social transformation in Western and Eastern Europe. In the areas under Soviet control, the Czechoslovakian Communist Party, led by Alexander Dubček, implemented reforms designed to create “socialism with a human face.” The changes granted citizens greater freedom of speech and travel and decentralized economic planning. The Soviet government, urged on by many of the Warsaw Pact leaders,  Question 2 Historical Background (continued) ended the Prague Spring by invading Czechoslovakia in 1968 and installing a communist hardliner. The events of 1968 raised doubts about the possibility of reforming communism and communist leaders’ abilities to be more responsive to the aspirations of their citizens. 4. The 1970s and 1980s The 1970s were a decade of growing economic hardship and demands for political freedom. In 1980, the announcement of higher food prices by the Polish government triggered a series of strikes and public demonstrations in Poland. The independent labor movement known as Solidarity, supported by the Polish Pope John Paul II and the Polish Catholic Church, challenged the legitimacy of communist rule. Although the movement was temporarily suppressed by the army, Polish communists failed to solve the economic crisis or command the enthusiastic support of the population. Few, however, anticipated that within the decade the Soviet Union would surrender control of its satellites or that communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe would disintegrate. Mikhail Gorbachev’s efforts to save communism in the Soviet Union loosened Soviet control in the satellite countries. Gorbachev’s pledge to allow all nations to pursue their own political destinies, coupled with continuing economic problems, resulted in negotiations between the Polish government and Solidarity leaders designed to carry out a peaceful transition of power. By the summer of 1989, Poland was led by a noncommunist leader for the first time in over four decades. The Polish example encouraged dissident groups in other Eastern European countries, and relatively peaceful transfers of political authority had occurred in Hungary, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia by the end of 1989. Gorbachev was surprised by the rapidity of the communist collapse but refused to intervene militarily. TERMS AND NAMES YOU MAY ENCOUNTER (Not to be treated as a checklist) Berlin Blockade and Airlift  Havel, Vaclav  Berlin Wall  John Paul II  Brezhnev Doctrine  Prague Spring  Comecon                                      “Socialism/communism with a human face”          De-Stalinization      Solidarity Movement  Dubček, Alexander  Velvet Revolution  Glasnost and perestroika  Walesa, Lech  Gorbachev, Mikhail      Warsaw Pact  Question 3 Considering the period 1918 to 1948, analyze the political and diplomatic problems faced by TWO of the following newly created Eastern European states. Austria Czechoslovakia Hungary Poland 9–8 Points • Thesis is explicit and responsive to the question; analyzes political and diplomatic problems. • Organization is clear and consistent; major assertions are developed effectively. • Essay is well balanced; analyzes both the political and diplomatic problems.  • Evidence is precise and relevant for both countries; analysis links historical events to problems. • May contain errors that do not detract from the argument. 7–6 Points • Thesis is explicit and addresses both political and diplomatic problems in a more general fashion. • Organization is clear and supports the argument. • Essay is balanced; contains some discussion of both the political and diplomatic problems. • Evidence may be stronger for one country than another; linkage between historical events and problems may be limited. • May contain an error that detracts from the argument. 5–4 Points • Thesis is not fully responsive to the question; may identify problems superficially. • Essay is not well organized; introduction or conclusion may be thin. • Essay shows some imbalance; political and diplomatic problems not distinguished. • Evidence is adequate though sparser on one country than another; may be more descriptive than analytical. • May contain errors that detract from the argument. 3–2 Points • Thesis is not explicit; may merely restate the question. • Organization is weak. • Essay shows serious imbalance; may merely mention political and diplomatic problems.  • Offers limited or confused evidence for either country; may be a list. • May contain several errors that detract from the argument. 1–0 Points • Thesis is vague or incomplete.  • Organization may be skeletal. • Political and diplomatic problems are described generically. • Minimal evidence used; may be off task or unfocused. • May contain numerous errors that detract from the argument. Question 3 Historical Background General themes: Failure of democracy and of principle of self-determination; Versailles settlement established new weak states; geopolitical problem (location near or between powerful neighbors); extreme right- and left-wing parties developed; rise of Nazism in 1930s; Soviet domination after Word War II; conflicts between ethnic minorities, especially in Czechoslovakia; Eastern European states were subject to Nazi domination and then to Soviet control (except Austria); Eastern Europeans were often not in charge of their own destinies. Poland • Poland had a turbulent post–World War I period, with wars against the Soviets, the Ukrainians, Germans, Lithuanians, and Czechs from 1918–1921. • Established a democratic government in 1922, but it lasted only eight years. • 68.9 percent of population ethnically Polish; 15 percent Ukrainian; 8.7 percent Jewish; 3.1 percent Belorussian; 2.3 percent German. • Democratic government overthrown by Joseph Pilsudski in a coup in 1926.  • New, conservative constitution in 1934 gave the president extraordinary powers. • Death of Pilsudski, 1935. Most often cited by students: Political problems: Internal conflict with ethnic minorities; anti-Semitism; re-created state that had not existed since the partitions; failure of democracy. Diplomatic problems: Buffer state; location between Germany and the Soviet Union; Invasion of 1939; Holocaust. Czechoslovakia • Sole surviving Eastern European democracy until Munich agreement. • Established the National Assembly in Prague. • Relatively stable from 1922 to 1929. • Thomas Masaryk was gifted leader. • Depression exacerbated ethnic tensions: 65 percent Czechs or Slovaks; 20 percent ethnic Germans (three million), often were pro-Nazi; 700,000 Hungarians. • Diplomacy failed on September 18, 1938. • Munich agreement allowed Hitler to take the Sudetenland. Most often cited by students: Political problems: Ethnic minorities, especially Germans in the Sudetenland; new state comprising Czechs and Slovaks (political plus: relatively stable and viable democracy). Diplomatic problems: Munich crisis; France and Britain did not live up to their promises; failure of League of Nations; Little Entente (Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania) was weak. Austria • Republic of “German Austria” founded in 1918. • Treaty of St. Germain (1919) made a relatively small state with a homogeneous population (except for Jews in Vienna). • Treaty included war reparations and prohibition of political or economic union with Germany without permission of League of Nations. • Fragile Republic to 1933: constitution ratified in 1920 with bicameral legislature. Question 3 Historical Background (continued) • Universal suffrage (including women) in 1920. • Parliamentary election returned Social Democrats and Christian Socialists in large number, with Nationalists a third party. System of proportional representation—neither party could dominate. Most often cited by students: Political problems: Loser in World War I; shrunken state; end of Hapsburg glory; Jewish minority and anti-Semitism; war reparations were supposed to be paid; forbidden to unite with Germany (or anyone) without permission of League of Nations. Diplomatic problems: Weakness of government; failure of democracy; Hitler’s (and many Austrians’) desire for Anschluss; end of independence, 1938. Hungary • Became independent in 1919 but lost much territory and population. • Communist coup in 1919 and brief rule by Béla Kun, followed by conservative reaction. • Monarch restored in absentia. • Dictatorship run by the landed aristocracy, with Admiral Horthy as “regent.” • General Gyula Gombos became prime minister in 1932. • Hungary was dictatorial and openly anti-Semitic. • Cooperated with Germany in its efforts at European domination.  Most often cited by students: Political problems: Loser in World War I; “dismembered” state with significant loss of territory and population; first communist rule, then dictatorship; discontent of Magyars. Diplomatic problems: Hard to find alliances; subordinate to Germany during World War II and then to the Soviet Union in the post-war period. Eastern Europe (1918–1948) Discussion from Donald Kagan, The Western Heritage “Trials of the Successor States in Eastern Europe” Problems faced by Poland, Austria, Czechoslovakia (Hungary is not mentioned in this section). Successor states were supposed to provide a buffer zone against Bolshevism and a bastion of self-determination. • They experienced difficulties establishing new parliamentary governments, and only Czechoslovakia did not end up with an authoritarian regime. • No tradition of self-government; ethnic division; new borders disrupted legal and economic systems; all were in debt (except Czechoslovakia). • All were “highly dependent on trade with Germany.” • All had “minority groups that wanted to become part of a different nation.” • Poland was big disappointment; class and ethnic differences ensured that parliamentary regime would fail; Pilsudski led a coup in 1926 and ruled until his death. Minority groups in Poland were identified: Ukrainians, Jews, Lithuanians, and Germans. “Czechoslovakia: A Viable Democratic Experiment”  • Czechs and Slovaks had cooperated during the war. • Leadership of Thomas Masaryk (1850–1937) was gifted and fair. Question 3 Historical Background (continued) • Other nation groups were discontented: Poles, Magyars, Ukrainians, and the Germans of the Sudetenland. • Appeasement at Munich meant the dismemberment and disappearance of Czechoslovakia and the creation of a Slovak client state. “Hungary: Turn to Authoritarianism” • Defeated power—separated from Austria but dismembered with loss of territory. • Short-lived Soviet republic under Béla Kun. • Admiral Horthy (1868–1957) made regent for Hapsburgs (even though the king could not take his throne). • Government was “parliamentary in form” but served aristocratic interests with rigged elections and anti-Semitism. “Austria: Political Turmoil and Nazi Occupation” • Paris settlement forbade union with Germany. • Christian Socialists vs. Social Democrats. • Christian Socialist Engelbert Dollfuss (1892–1934) was chancellor. • Growing power of Nazi Party in Austria; Dollfuss shot during unsuccessful Nazi coup; Schuschnigg ruled until Anschluss. “Austria and Czechoslovakia” • Anschluss (March 12, 1938) resulted in Nazi regime surrounding Czechoslovakia. • Hitler’s threats lead to Chamberlain’s concession of the Sudetenland and Munich agreement, September 29, 1938.  • Prague occupied, March 15, 1939. • Poland pressed to give up Danzig; Britain and France guarantee Polish independence, leading to outbreak of World War II. Nazi–Soviet Pact of August 23, 1939 “sealed the fate of Poland.” “Polish Anti-Semitism between the Wars” • Pilsudski favored including Jews “within the civic definition of the nation.”  • But after Pilsudski’s death, government pursued anti-Semitic policies supported by spokesmen of Polish Catholic Church. • Jews were discriminated against in hiring and excluded from civil service, so they moved into law and medicine. • Poles refused to regard even secular, assimilated Jews as fellow Poles. • In spite of Polish anti-Semitism, Nazis alone were responsible for the destruction of the Polish Jewish community. “Soviet Domination of Eastern Europe”  • Eastern European satellites were to be buffer for Soviets. • February 1948, son of Masaryk (Jan) murdered (fell out of a window mysteriously); Edvard Beneš forced to resign, and Czechoslovakia brought under Soviet one-party rule. • Stalin’s harsh politics were due to Tito’s escape from Soviet domination. Question 3 Historical Background (continued) Discussion from R. J.

There is no easy answer. Thinkers outside of England and the Netherlands believed that political change could best come from above, rather than from below, especially in Central and Eastern Europe. It was necessary to educate and “enlighten” the monarch, who could then make good laws and promote human happiness. Influenced by philosophical authors and government officials, some absolutist rulers of the later eighteenth century tried to govern in an “enlightened” manner. Yet the actual programs and accomplishments of these rulers varied greatly. It is necessary to examine the evolution of monarchial absolutism before trying to judge the Enlightenment’s effect and the meaning of what historians have often called the enlightened absolutism of the later eighteenth century. Discussion from Jackson Spielvogel, Western Civilization Since 1300 There is no doubt that Enlightenment thought had some impact on the political development of European states in the eighteenth century. The philosophes believed in a variety of natural rights Most philosophes believed that people needed to be ruled by enlightened rulers. But what made them enlightened? They must allow religious toleration, freedom of speech and press, and the rights of private property. They must foster the arts, sciences, and education. Above all, they must obey the law and enforce it fairly for all subjects. Only strong monarchs such as Frederick II of Prussia, Catherine the Great, and Joseph II of Austria supposedly followed the advice of the philosophes and ruled by enlightened principles. Discussion from John Merriman, A History of Modern Europe It is to the Enlightenment that we trace the origins of many of our most strongly held political beliefs: the idea that people should be ruled by law, not rulers; the belief that a separation of powers ought to exist within government; the concept of popular sovereignty (authority should be wholly or at least partly based in the people, reflecting their interests, if not their consent); and the assumption that it is the responsibility of rulers to look after the welfare of the people. Limitations on Enlightened Absolutism Discussion from John McKay, A History of Western Society Necessities of state and maintenance often took precedence over reform. Indeed, many historians maintain that Frederick and Joseph were primarily guided by a concern for the power and well-being of their states. In the final analysis, heightened state power was used to create armies and wage wars to gain more power. It would be foolish, however, to overlook the fact that the ability of enlightened rulers to make reforms was also limited by political and social realities. Everywhere in Europe, the hereditary aristocracy was still the most powerful class in society. As the chief beneficiaries of a system based on traditional rights and privileges for their class, they were not willing to support a political ideology that trumpeted the principle of equal rights for all. The first serious challenge to their supremacy would come with the French Revolution. Question 5 Compare and contrast the economic factors responsible for the decline of Spain with the economic factors responsible for the decline of the Dutch Republic by the end of the seventeenth century. 9–8 Points • Thesis is clearly stated and addresses BOTH a comparison and a contrast for the decline of Spain and the Dutch Republic by the end of the seventeenth century (e.g., “While both Spain and the Dutch Republic suffered from massive military expenditures, the decline of Spain was more self-inflicted than the decline of the Dutch Republic”). • Organization is clear, consistently followed, and effective in support of the argument. • Essay is well balanced; even treatment of points of comparison as well as points of contrast. • All major assertions in the essay are supported by multiple pieces of relevant evidence and historical specificity. • Essay makes connections between the events of the sixteenth century to the economic decline by the end of the seventeenth century; analyzes the factors of cause and effect. • May contain some errors that do not detract from the argument (e.g., calling the First Anglo–Dutch War the Nutmeg War or making the assertion that the primary cause of hyperinflation was the flood of bullion into Europe). 7–6 Points • Thesis is clearly stated and addresses BOTH parts of the question. • Organization is clear. • Essay is somewhat balanced, though the treatment of some points of comparison and some points of contrast might be uneven. • All major assertions in the essay are supported by at least one piece of relevant evidence or historical specificity. • Essay makes connections between the events of the sixteenth century to the economic decline by the end of the seventeenth century; analyzes the factors of cause and effect. • Might contain some errors that do not detract from the argument. 5–4 Points • Thesis is clearly stated but might be uneven.

R. Palmer, A History of the Modern World Jackson Spielvogel, Western Civilization Since 1300 The purpose of this question was to investigate the phenomenon of economic decline on the part of two major European powers by the end of the seventeenth century. Spain and the Dutch Republic were two enormously wealthy and powerful European states in the sixteenth century. Within one hundred years, both were in a state of economic downturn. The question investigates what happened economically and the reasons why. Both Spain and the Dutch Republic declined economically for similar reasons: unrelenting foreign competition, smothering military expenditures, crippling inflation, and population issues. There were, however, major differences between the two. • The economic decline of Spain was self-inflicted; the economic decline of the Dutch Republic was a crisis of geography. • The economic decline of Spain was absolute; the economic decline of the Dutch Republic was relative. • The economic decline of Spain was due to the catastrophic mismanagement of resources; the economic decline of the Dutch Republic was the result of hubris caused by a stellar management of resources. • The economic decline of Spain stemmed from the lack of a middle class; the economic decline of the Dutch Republic can be traced back to the middle class. • The economic decline of Spain came from military defeats; the economic decline of the Dutch Republic stemmed from military victories. Question 6 Analyze the various ways in which the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648) represented a turning point in European history. 9–8 Points • Thesis is explicit and fully responds to the question. o Refers to three significant results of the Thirty Years’ War representing a turning point. • Organization is clear and effectively supports the argument. o Body paragraphs go on to develop the various results of the Thirty Years’ War as alluded to in the thesis. • Essay is well balanced; multiple turning points required by the question are covered at length. • All major assertions in the essay are supported by relevant, specific examples. o Examples document major turning points in European history caused by the Thirty Years’ War. • May contain errors or off-topic content that does not detract from the argument. 7–6 Points • Thesis is explicit and responds to the terms of the question. o May refer to only two results, or may refer to three results in a less sophisticated manner. • Essay is organized and supports the argument, but may stray off task. o May merge factors in single paragraphs. • Essay is relatively balanced; at least two turning points are covered. o Some factors may be more developed than others. • All major assertions in the essay are supported by at least one piece of relevant evidence. • May contain an error or off-topic content that detracts from the argument but does not significantly interfere with the task of the essay. 5–4 Points • Thesis is explicit but not fully responsive to the question. o May only refer to one significant turning point factor or to two factors minimally. o Some turning point factors may be inaccurate. • Essay is organized and consistently followed, but may ineffectively connect to the question. o May be more of a chronological narrative of the Thirty Years’ War rather than an analytical essay dealing with the requirements of the question. • Essay shows some imbalance, perhaps developing only one turning point factor. • The major turning point in the essay is supported by at least one specific example. • May contain a few errors that detract from the argument. 3–2 Points • Thesis is weak or general. • Essay is poorly organized OR simply a narrative of the Thirty Years’ War OR demonstrates little/no knowledge of valid turning points. • Essay shows serious imbalance, failing to accurately develop any of the terms of the question. • Supports few if any of the assertions with relevant evidence. • May contain several errors that detract from the argument. Question 6 (continued) 1–0 Points • No discernable attempt at an accurate thesis. • Response suggests little or no understanding of the question. • Ignores most of the major turning points. • Uses little or no relevant supporting evidence. • May contain numerous errors that detract from the argument. Question 6 Historical Background This question was intended to have the students place the Thirty Years’ War in a larger diplomatic, social, political, and/or economic context. Students were not required to use those particular categories of analysis, but they were expected to analyze several outcomes of the Thirty Years’ War that established it as a major transition from one era of European history to the next.  Decline of the importance of religion as a motive for conflict • The alliances across the Protestant–Catholic divide (France’s support for Sweden; Lutheran support for the Holy Roman Empire later in the war) and the rivalries within the Protestant and Catholic camps ultimately had the effect of making religion less important as a motive for conflict.  • The reaffirmation and extension of the cuis regio eius religio principle, set at the Peace of Augsburg, as a part of the Peace of Westphalia also tended to dampen religious differences as a source of conflict. • Students may talk about the rise of toleration in the post-1648 European world. • Students may also discuss a rise of secularism and the decline of papal influence, made very clear at the Westphalia negotiations where the papal representative was ignored. The pope never signed the treaties of Münster and Osnabruck, known together as the Peace of Westphalia. • The Peace of Westphalia effectively halted the Counter-Reformation in the German states. It added Calvinism to the list of acceptable faiths. The end of the Holy Roman Empire as an effective entity • By the end of the war, the (Austrian) Hapsburgs had given up any pretensions to wielding effective power over the German-speaking states in Central Europe.  o United Provinces and Swiss cantons withdrew from the Holy Roman Empire. • The more than 300 German states became virtually sovereign states. They had the right to ratify any laws, taxes, wars, etc. in the Reichstag. Some students will erroneously refer to the post-1648 Austrian world as the beginning of the Hapsburg’s eventual demise. • The Austrian Empire turned its attention to eastward expansion against the Ottoman Empire. Students may discuss the reorganization of the Austrian state.  o Bohemia and Hungary now under tighter central control and re-Catholicized. Rise of France • Students will often discuss the rise of France, led by Cardinal Richelieu, who masterminded the anti-Hapsburg policy, both Austrian and Spanish. • France received portions of Alsace and Lorraine at the Peace of Westphalia. • Students may go on to discuss how Louis XIV built on this foundation, raising France to unparalleled heights in the later seventeenth century. Question 6 Historical Background (continued) The decimation of the German states and the rise of Prussia • Some historians argue that the destruction caused by the war (perhaps as much as a third of the German population perished) set back the Germanic state’s economic development relative to England and France. The economic power of the Hanseatic League was effectively ended.  • The Thirty Years’ War also confirmed the long-term division of Germany into numerous small states—none of which could rival the power of England or France. Some students may imply that this fragmentation was initiated by the Thirty Years’ War and the Peace of Westphalia. • Some students may discuss the beginning of the rise of Prussia as a reaction to its ordeal during the Thirty Years’ War, led by the Great Elector Frederick William (1640-88) and trace Prussia’s leadership to eventual German unification under Bismarck. • By the Peace of Westphalia, Prussia received eastern Pomerania, Halberstadt, and Magdeburg. Changes in the process of diplomacy • The Peace of Westphalia assumed the principle of mutual recognition of sovereignty and marked the beginning of the modern system of diplomatic relations; a Staatensystem—or modern system of sovereign states. • Some students will refer to subsequent treaties (e.g., Utrecht, Vienna, and Versailles) as examples of Westphalia’s influence. Decline of Poland and rise of Sweden • The Thirty Years’ War contributed to the decline of Poland. Poland’s defeat by Sweden ended Poland’s attempts to dominate the Baltic Sea region. • The Thirty Years’ War led to the beginning of a brief period of Swedish ascendancy that lasted for about sixty years. Students may discuss Gustavus Adolphus as the leader of that development and may allude to Charles XII (1697–1718) as carrying on that development.  • By the Peace of Westphalia, Sweden received Bremen, Verden, and western Pomerania (including city of Stettin). End of Spanish influence in Northern Europe, Dutch independence • Spanish influence eroded in Northern Europe. The achievement of Dutch independence in 1648 deprived Spain of an effective foothold in Northern Europe and greatly diminished it as a rival to England and France. • United Provinces was recognized as a sovereign state and received from Portugal the right to have outposts in Brazil and Indonesia and gain greater control over maritime trade; closure of the Scheldt to ocean-going vessels was confirmed. Question 6 Historical Background (continued) Military revolution • Students may discuss how advances in military organization (e.g., the Swedish army under Gustavus Adolphus) led to more organized armies (regiments) where the central authority wielded more control instead of nobles/mercenary commanders. Gustavus Adolphus also implemented new tactics with more flexible lines of pikemen and muskets and more mobile artillery. Improved military training led to more professionalized fighting forces that were not disbanded at the end of the war or the campaign season. With Wallenstein we see the approach to warfare as a business for personal aggrandizement with more enforced rules of engagement. • Army size increased significantly. During the Thirty Years’ War, the French army had 125,000 men and grew to 250,000 by the Dutch War (1672-78). The Swedish army had 150,000 men by 1632 (growth due to conscription). • All of this required supporting bureaucracies to expand, as well as increased taxes, placing new burdens on the populations, especially the lower orders. Question 7 Analyze how Galileo, Descartes, and Newton altered traditional interpretations of nature and challenged traditional sources of knowledge. 9–8 Points • Thesis is explicit and addresses both traditional interpretations of nature and challenges to sources of knowledge (themes). • Organization is clear, consistently followed, and effective in support of the argument. • Essay is well balanced and identifies and explains contributions of the three men toward BOTH interpretations of nature and sources of knowledge. • Contributions of each individual (Galileo, Descartes, and Newton) are supported and fully substantiated by several specific pieces of relevant evidence (three individuals = five to six specifics total). • May contain errors that do not detract from the argument. 7–6 Points • Thesis is explicit and responsive to the question. Discusses either interpretation of nature OR sources of knowledge without development. • Organization is clear in support of the argument. • Essay is balanced and identifies and explains contributions of the three individuals. Two or three individuals must be linked to either interpretations of nature OR sources of knowledge, and both themes must be addressed at some point. Links to interpretations or sources are clearly demonstrated. • Contributions of each individual are partially supported by specific evidence with at least one specific piece for each individual (three individuals = three to four specifics). • May contain minor errors that detract from the argument (including linking Descartes with  observational science). 5–4 Points • Thesis is explicit but not fully responsive to the question (may not clearly identify interpretations of nature or sources of knowledge). • Organization is clear and effective in support of the argument but not consistently followed. • Each individual must be addressed, but a clear lack of balance may be evident. • Several pieces of specific, relevant evidence (two to three) that address at least two of the individuals are included. • Contains a limited discussion of the two themes (traditional interpretations of nature or sources of knowledge) or a thorough discussion of one. • Weaker essays may contain major errors. 3–2 Points • Does not contain an explicit thesis, or the thesis merely repeats/paraphrases the question. • Organization is unclear and ineffective; it does not support analysis. • Essay shows serious imbalance; themes demanded by the question are neglected. • May only mention themes (interpretations of nature or sources of knowledge) without discussion or analysis. • Does not discuss one of the three individuals, and those that are discussed are supported only by generic evidence; discussion may ramble. • Weaker essays may contain major errors that detract from the argument. Question 7 (continued) 1–0 Points • No discernable attempt at a thesis, or thesis is off task. • No discernable organization. • One or none of the major themes (interpretations of nature and sources of knowledge) suggested by the question is mentioned. • Typically may contain a single specific valid reference to an individual. • May mention some or all of the individuals without correct supporting evidence or attempted explanations. • May contain numerous errors that detract from the argument. Note: Traditional interpretations of nature include a geocentric world (Aristotle/Ptolemy), superstitions, and religious views (perfection of natural world). Traditional sources of knowledge include the Church, the Bible, classical authors, and scholastics. Question 7 Historical Background This question was intended to elicit students’ knowledge of the Scientific Revolution as exemplified by the work of three of the most important figures of the age. The prompt suggests two themes. A discussion of alterations to traditional interpretations of nature should include some account of how the work of Galileo, Descartes, and Newton differed from earlier constructions of the cosmos and humanity’s place in it. A discussion of challenges to traditional sources of knowledge should include some consideration of how the three broke with the well-established methods and principles of science. Two of the predominant issues of the times are suggested by the themes of the prompt: altered traditional interpretations of nature and challenges to traditional sources of knowledge. These themes are in fact not completely separable, although most students made an attempt to do so. Alterations of traditional interpretations: Common to all three was a challenge, whether implicit or explicit, to the Aristotelian and classical worldview espoused by scholastic philosophers and endorsed by the Catholic Church. Galileo explicitly challenged the classical model of a geocentric universe, which in the version endorsed by the Church encompassed moral as well as physical dimensions. Galileo also challenged the notion of a separation between the unchanging perfect heavens and the unstable, imperfect sublunary world. Newton systematized Galileo’s insight about the fundamental unity of the earthly and the celestial realms and raised the possibility of a purely mechanistic universe driven by predictable laws. Challenges to traditional sources of knowledge: The alteration of traditional interpretations of nature carried with them an implicit or explicit refutation of the authorities that had helped form those interpretations. Galileo’s account of the universe conflicted with both the Bible and classical authorities such as Aristotle and Ptolemy. Descartes’s concentration on reasoning based on empirical observation and deduction from first principles left no room for revelation. Descartes’s and Newton’s creation of mathematical descriptions of natural phenomenon established a new scientific practice that would generate knowledge not from established authorities but from careful experimentation, observation, and formulation of new mathematically grounded descriptions. The following is a select listing of the type of information students could be expected to know based on general textbooks currently in use. Galileo Galilei, 1564–1642 • Telescope, 1609. • Moon was rough, imperfect, like the Earth, hence not composed of some perfect celestial substance. • Leaning Tower Trial (1591) showed that objects fall toward the Earth at equal rates regardless of weight. • Experimental method. • Two New Sciences. • Law of Inertia. • Discovered four moons of Jupiter. • Sidereus Nunicus (Starry Messenger) examines the moon. • Pope Urban VIII allowed Galileo to write Dialogue on the Two Chief Systems of the World, 1632. • Galileo’s trial became symbol of conflict between religious belief and scientific thinking. Question 7 Historical Background (continued) • Heliocentric proponent. • Discovered that Venus has phases, as the moon does, implying that it revolves around the sun. • “It still moves.” • Use of inclined planes for motion study. René Descartes, 1596–1650 • Created coordinate geometry. • Discourse on Method, 1637. • “Cogito ergo sum.” • “Cartesian Dualism.” • “Give me motion and extension and I will build you the world.” • Wrote tracts urging honesty in religion. • Analytic geometry. • Deductive reasoning from self-evident principles. • Father of modern rationalism. • Applied science to philosophy. • Wrote in vernacular to show modernism. • Materialism shows humanity can live independently from God. Sir Isaac Newton, 1642–1727 • Development of calculus. • Combined Kepler and Galileo on motion. • Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (1687) known as Principia. • Humans no longer center of universe. • Wrote tracts urging honesty in religion. • Universal Law of Gravity. • Three Laws of Motion. • World machine—operates in time and space. • Connected to founding of Deism. • Promoted scientific experiment. • Found density of earth to be five times greater than water. • Electrical impulses trigger nervous system. • 1671, light can be mathematically described. • Rejected Descartes’s theory that world is made totally of matter.
