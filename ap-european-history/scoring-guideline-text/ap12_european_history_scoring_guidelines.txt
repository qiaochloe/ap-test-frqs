Thesis must not simply restate the question. The thesis must address at least two arguments concerning improvements in European workers’ lives with some degree of specificity. The thesis need not appear in the first paragraph; it may be found in the conclusion. 2. Discusses a majority of the documents individually and specifically. The essay must use at least seven documents — even if used incorrectly — by reference to anything in the box. Documents cannot be referenced collectively to get credit for this point (e.g., “Documents 2, 3, and 6 suggest … ”) unless the essay goes on to discuss them individually. 3. Demonstrates understanding of the basic meaning of a majority of the documents (may misinterpret no more than one). The essay may not significantly misinterpret more than one document. A major misinterpretation is an incorrect analysis OR one that leads to an inaccurate grouping. An essay cannot earn this point if no credit was awarded for point 2 (discusses a majority of the documents). 4. Supports the thesis with appropriate interpretations of a majority of the documents. The essay must use at least seven documents correctly and analytically in the body of the essay to provide support for the thesis. An essay cannot earn this point if no credit was awarded for point 1 (appropriate thesis). An essay also cannot earn this point if no credit was awarded for point 2 (discusses a majority of the documents). 5. Analyzes point of view or bias in at least three documents. The essay must make a reasonable effort to explain why a particular source expresses the stated view by • relating authorial point of view to author’s place in society (motive, position, status, etc.); OR • evaluating the reliability of the source; OR • recognizing that different kinds of documents serve different purposes; OR • analyzing the tone of the documents; must be clear and relevant. Note: 1. Attribution alone is not sufficient to earn credit for point of view (POV). 2. It is possible for essays to discuss point of view collectively (includes two or three documents in making a single POV analysis), but this counts for only one point of view. 6. Analyzes documents by explicitly organizing them in at least three appropriate groups. A group must contain at least two documents that are used correctly and individually. Groupings and corresponding documents may include the following (not exclusive). Arguments Regarding Improvements of Workers’ Lives* • Laissez-faire/noninterventionist/classical economist: documents 1, 2, 10 • State interventionist/reformist/activist/socialist: documents 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12 • Radical: documents 5, 6, 8, 11 • Revolutionary: documents 5, 6, 11 • “Unity”: documents 4, 5, 9, 11 • Working women’s rights: documents 5, 8 • Expanded suffrage/workers’ rights: documents 4, 8, 12 *These themes may be incorporated into chronologically structured essays that emphasize change over time. Expanded Core: 0–3 points to a total of 9 points The essay merits credit beyond the basic core of 1–6 points. The basic score of 6 must be achieved before an essay can earn expanded core points. Credit awarded in the expanded core should be based on holistic assessment of the essay. Factors to consider in holistic assessment may include the following:  • Presents a clear, analytical, and comprehensive thesis. • Uses all or almost all the documents (10–12 documents). • Uses the documents persuasively as evidence. • Shows understanding of nuances of the documents. • Analyzes point of view or bias in at least four documents cited in the essay. • Analyzes the documents in additional ways (e.g., develops more groupings). • Recognizes and develops change over time. • Brings in relevant outside information. Document Summary Document 1: Thomas Malthus, English economist, An Essay on the Principle of Population, second edition, 1803 The causes of poverty and social inequality cannot be resolved by the rich or by government intervention; the poor should have patience. Document 2: David Ricardo, English economist, Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, 1817 Legislative reforms to increase workers’ wages (e.g., the Poor Laws) run counter to the principles of free-market enterprise (laissez-faire); further, Ricardo shifts responsibility to the poor and suggests ironically that the legislature regulate population size. Note: the principal thrust of this document is that Ricardo opposes government intervention. Document 3: Saint-Amand Bazard, French social theorist, public lecture, 1828 Laissez-faire policies are not effective in alleviating miseries of the poor in the short term.  Document 4: London Workingmen’s Association, petition to Parliament for the “People’s Charter,” 1838 Granting the suffrage to all workers over the age of 21 will relieve the suffering of the laboring poor. Document 5: Flora Tristan, French writer and political activist, The Workers’ Union, 1843 Only through unity will the working class be able to demand concessions from the bourgeoisie, and the unity of working men and women will result in gender equality. Document 6: Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, German Social theorists, The German Ideology, 1845–1846 A wholesale revolution is the only way to achieve the overthrow of the ruling class. Document 7: Louis Blanc, French political leader, The Organization of Labor, introduction to the second edition, 1848 Only strong government intervention can successfully overturn laissez-faire principles in order to alleviate social inequality. Document 8: Pauline Roland, French writer and political activist, letter to the editor of the French newspaper Universal Well-Being, 1851 Women should have a right to the same employment opportunities as men in order to establish their independence. Document 9: Ferdinand Lassalle, German political activist, “The Workers’ Program,” public speech delivered in Berlin, 1862 Only the state, ruled by the ideas of the working class, can promote and protect the moral principles of equality for all people. Document 10: John Stuart Mill, English political theorist and member of Parliament, Chapters on Socialism, unfinished book, begun in 1869 and published posthumously in 1879 Contrary to the beliefs of Socialists, the current system of liberal government is slowly eradicating social injustices. Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) Document Summary (continued) Document 11: Central Electoral Committee of the Eleventh Arrondissement of the city of Paris during the period of the Paris Commune, 1871 The realization of the commune will ensure the establishment of individual rights for all citizens and eliminate class distinctions.  Document 12: Alexandre Millerand, member of the French national legislature, speech, 1896  Suffrage seeks to establish economic and political liberation for all, rather than to resort to revolution. There are many means by which an essay can demonstrate point-of-view analysis in this DBQ.  Examples of ACCEPTABLE Point-of-View Analysis Relating authorial point of view to author’s place in society 1. “Tristan tried to spread unity among her readers by suggesting that strong union will be difficult to break by others of higher standing or social ranking. Having felt the vulnerability and difficulties of being a woman, Tristan acknowledged the fact that equality should not be limited to one gender.”  2. “David Ricardo stated that wages should not be controlled by government. As a classical economist and supporter of laissez-faire, Ricardo would have collected factual evidence to reinforce his conclusion that free markets should continue.” 3. “Marx and Engels were two of the most anti-capitalistic men of their era and it is easy to see that their main course of action would be to overthrow the imperialistic, capitalistic governments of Europe.” 4. “The Workingmen’s Association, made up of members of the class most afflicted by the government’s apathy, experienced first-hand the problems caused by a lack of representation.” Evaluating the reliability of the source 1. “Bazard is speaking in a public lecture, implying that he was trying to gain the worker’s favor by pointing out the cruelties of capitalism.”  2. “But the fact that Louis Blanc is a French political leader where the workers were more inclined to demand equality and betterment of living standards, indicates that he may have inevitably chosen to cater to their needs to gain their support and bring stability to France.” 3. “Roland, a writer and political activist, expressed her ideals of gender equality. She, as a woman like Tristan, is a reliable source of the reformist viewpoint that many women held on the topic of gender equality.” Recognizing that different kinds of documents serve different purposes 1. “By presenting his view in a public lecture, Bazard intended to whip up popular support for his agenda.” 2. “By presenting a petition to Parliament the London Workingmen’s Association hoped to gain approval for new legislation to extend the suffrage to workers over the age of 21.” 3. “In publishing her views in an activist newspaper like Universal Well-Being Roland could be certain to spread the word over a large audience of Frenchmen.” AP® EUROPEAN HISTORY 2012 SCORING GUIDELINES  Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) A Closer Look at Point of View (continued) Analyzing the tone of the documents 1. “Saint-Amand Bazard argues that laissez-faire economics demands that a worker sit by and wait on the reassurance that he will get food in a few years. He claims that in the midst of “thousands who are starving” merely waiting until the invisible hand balances the economy is absurd.” 2. “The urgency and passion of this document was obviously intended to appeal to workers’ emotions and inspire revolution, making it propaganda.” 3. “Louis Blanc proclaims passionately that strong government intervention should undermine laissez-faire policies and thus achieve freedom for all.” Examples of UNACCEPTABLE Point-of-View Analysis 1. “The point of view is that of workers who have decided to stand up to the government” (doc. 1). Why unacceptable? The essay explains workers’ action but does not explain why it represents a bias. 2. “Marx would most likely promote his theory of socialism at all costs since he completely believed in it.” Why unacceptable? This argument is circular and could be said of all authors. The essay does not explain why Marx holds this theory. 3. “This source is biased as Blanc is a political leader and is most likely a conservative as he is pushing for the idea of increased government control.” Why unacceptable? The statement incorrectly identifies Blanc as a conservative. 4. “These two individuals’ views are fueled by their gender.” Why unacceptable? The essay makes no connection between gender and the issues they are promoting. 5. “Ricardo’s work was published in a book and can be read as reliable and informed, as he is a very educated man.” Why unacceptable? There must be more explicit explanation of the source of a person’s credibility than a generic situation of simply publishing work or having education. 6. “Pauline Roland, although biased because she is a woman, advocated in a letter to the editor of a French newspaper that women should receive the same rights as men are entitled to, including complete independence of work and home.”  Why unacceptable? The essay presents little more than attribution (a woman) to explain why Roland holds these stated views. Analyze various ways in which technological developments contributed to the expansion of state power in the period 1450 to 1600. 9–8 points • Thesis explicitly explains various ways in which technological developments contributed to the expansion of state power. Thesis may appear in conclusion. • Organization is clear, consistently followed, and effective in providing one or more well-developed causal linkages to increased state power. • Essay is well balanced, discussing both technological developments and expansion of state power, though it may offer less discussion of one or the other. • Provides evidence of two or more technological innovations in detail. • May contain errors in fact or chronology that do not detract from the argument. 7–6 points • Thesis explains various ways in which technological developments contributed to the expansion of state power. Causal linkage is present but may be less evident. • Organization is clear and effective but may be less consistent by providing one or more developed linkages to increased state power. • Essay is relatively balanced, discussing both technological developments and expansion of state power, though discussion of one or the other may be clearly less developed. • Provides evidence of two or more technological innovations. • May contain an error in fact or chronology that detracts from the argument. 5–4 points • Thesis attempts to explain various ways in which technological developments contributed to the expansion of state power, but the explanation may be vague or confused. • Organization is clear but may only partly provide causal linkage to increased state power. • Essay may be imbalanced, focusing on technological developments and making only general reference to growing state power or vice versa. • Provides evidence of at least one technological innovation. • May contain a few errors in fact or chronology that detract from the argument. 3–2 points • Thesis may restate the prompt or offer little or no explanation of various ways in which technological developments contributed to the expansion of state power. • Organization may be apparent but offers no causal linkage to increased state power. • Essay may show serious imbalance, with parts of the prompt neglected or misconstrued. • May offer some evidence of technological innovation. • May contain several errors in fact or chronology that detract from the argument. 1–0 points • Thesis may be absent or repeat the prompt. • Organization may be coincidental, with no causal linkage to increased state power. • Essay may show gross imbalance, ignoring parts of the prompt. • May offer little, ineffectual, or irrelevant evidence of technological innovation. • May contain numerous errors in fact or chronology that detract from the argument. The Question • Requires students to explain how technological developments helped increase state power. • These developments and increase of powers must generally take place between 1450 and 1600. • Plurality of first part of the prompt requires students to discuss two or more examples of innovation. • Expansion of state power is singular and nonspecific; may be discussed by state or by phenomenon. Clarification • Technological developments can mean invention (e.g., movable-type print) and innovation (e.g., cartography). Compass and gunpowder are acceptable. Nontechnological developments (banking, double bookkeeping, etc.) should not be credited. Innovation must relate to rise in state power. • Examples of innovation may come from the same field (e.g., caravel and lateen sail as part of discussion on ships) or different fields. • Time frame may include bordering innovations (e.g., cannons 1380, telescope 1608). However, references to (early) Middle Ages and the Enlightenment are clearly out-of-bounds. The Essay • Thesis must link technical innovation to expanding state power (i.e., how). • Organization must show causal linkage between innovation and state power, either through one well-developed connection or through multiple connections. • Balance must be shown through discussion of both innovation and state power. Some essays may be more focused on  innovation than on state power. Such imbalance is acceptable as long as it is not too severe. • Evidence must support at least two innovations. Clarification • Strong essays have explicit theses. Medium essays may imply linkage to state power or deem such a connection obvious. Weak essays state but seldom link innovation to state power. • Strong essays explicitly state how/why the discussed innovation contributed to the rise of state power. Medium essays may describe this in less evident or partial terms. Weak essays often fail to address state power beyond paraphrasing the prompt. • Strong essays display sophistication in balancing the prompt, through either an extended discussion or greater variety of examples. Medium essays often discuss two to three examples in less sophisticated terms. Weak essays often lack balance, ignoring or misconstruing state power. • Strong essays often distinguish themselves through well-chosen evidence. Medium essays may also display mastery of fact, though of limited time or nature. Weak essays may offer generalizations in lieu of evidence. Scoring • Students have a limited time to complete the essay at the end of a long exam. Essays do not need to be exhaustive to earn high scores. On the other hand, they must show evidentiary intent: a lucky fact or evidence out of period/context does not raise an essay. Key is how well the essay engages the entire prompt.  • Essays must respond to the prompt in the thesis (how). This may be explicit (strong essays) or implied/less evident (medium essays). Theses that repeat the prompt or have no linkage despite rich narratives in the body paragraphs earn low scores • Explicit (i.e., furthering the argument) discussion of incorrect or out-of-period information constitutes a serious error. Extraneous information not contributing to the argument may be ignored. Misstatements in context due to speed or fatigue (typewriter instead of movable type) should not detract. Persistent misstatements throughout the essay do constitute an error. Historical Background (based on Eugene Rice, The Foundation of Early Modern Europe, 1460–1559. New York: Norton 1970) During the feudal monarchies of the Late Middle Ages, the king was weak and his vassals powerful. This landed military aristocracy held private hereditary rights to wage war, to tax, and to administer and enforce the law — rights normally attributed to the sovereign state. However, the period 1450–1600 marked a significant stage of transition in which the royals of Europe consolidated their power and their holdings with various degrees of success. By the end of the 16th century, the king’s officers had mostly displaced vassals as local governors, while a professional mercenary force lessened the latter’s role in war. Exploration in turn expanded empire and contributed to the treasury. By 1559 states were more sovereign than feudal. Technological innovations contributed significantly to this expansion of state power. The application of gunpowder as the propellant for cannon balls quickly breached the stone walls of cities and castles, while arquebusiers and musketeers in concert with pikemen decimated the mailed knight chevaliers on the battle field. The invention of movable-type printing and paper allowed for quick dissemination of royal decrees and odes of royal greatness, as well as extending the royal reach for censorship of adversarial or protestant writings. The printed book allowed the scholars of Europe to cooperatively question the long-held conventions of the Church, and for Lutheranism to spread like wildfire. Innovations in ship design, ship armament, and navigation turned Portugal and Spain into seafaring empires, in which bounty financed further state usurpation of power. Examples of People • Warfare o Mehmed II (ruled 1451–1481) breached the walls of Constantinople. o Charles VII completed 60 castle sieges in one year. o General Fernando de Avalos (1489–1525) perfected the modern infantry. o Philip II (ruled 1554–1598) sent the Armada to sail against Elizabeth I (ruled 1558–1603) in 1588. • Printing: Printing with movable type was perfected by Johan Gutenberg (1395–1468), Johann Fust (1400–1465), and Peter Schöffer (1425–1502), among others.  • Science o Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543) published On the Revolutions of Celestial Spheres in 1543. o Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) was the greatest of Italian artist-engineers. o Agricola, also known as Georg Bauer (1490–1555), wrote the textbook on mining and metallurgy De re Metallica (1556). • Exploration o Prince Henry the Navigator (1394–1460) sponsored exploration for sea routes to India and to combat Muslim infidels. o King John II (ruled 1481–1495) was an avid expansionist.  o Bartholomeu Dias (1450–1500) voyaged around the Cape. o Vasco da Gama (1469–1524) sailed to India, where Alfonso de Albuquerque (1453–1515) established the Portuguese empire in the Indian Ocean. o Pedro Cabral (1468–1520) discovered Brazil. o Isabella of Castile (1451–1504) and Ferdinand of Aragon (1452–1515) commissioned Christopher Columbus (1451–1506) to sail for the New World (“India”) to conquer riches and smite heathens. o Amerigo Vespucci (1451–1512) explored Rio de la Plata for Spain, while Ferdinand Magellan (1480–1521) rounded the southern strait to the Pacific Ocean. o Conquistadores Hernan Cortes (1485–1547) and Francisco Pizarro (1470–1541) subjugated and looted the Aztec and Inca empires.  o Vasco Nunez de Balboa (1475–1519) traversed the Panama isthmus. o John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto, 1450–1499), on commission of Henry VIII (1491–1547), sought out Brazil but found Newfoundland. Innovations Described in Textbooks • Print: movable-type printing, paper making • Gunpowder: cannon, arquebus, musket • Ships: caravel, fluyt (fluit), lateen sail (with square rig), sternpost or axial rudder, mounted cannon • Navigation: cartography, portolani (detailed navigational regional charts), magnetic compass, astrolabe, tide calendar Examples of Expansion of State Power • Lessening the lord-vassal dependency;

Responses should attempt to make an explicit linkage between artistic developments and religious reform. Essays that are limited to describing artistic developments, even in detail, without linking them to religious reform have not fully addressed the prompt. Essays in the highest scoring range (8–9) should address both Protestant and Catholic reforms. Note that the phrasing “the arts” was kept deliberately open; students may discuss anything that might be considered part of the arts — they are not limited to the visual arts, nor are they expected to cover the full range of the arts.  This topic seems to be addressed explicitly in most European history textbooks. Most commonly, texts noted the simplicity sought in architecture and the visual arts among many Protestant movements and the connections between Catholicism and the Baroque movement. However, most textbooks do not contain extended discussions or examples beyond the visual arts. Historical Background The role of the arts in the Reformation era was a source of some controversy. Catholics and Protestants disagreed with each other, and there was also considerable disagreement among various Protestant groups. By the early sixteenth century, a Christian (northern) humanist movement emerged, which combined an appreciation for classical learning with Christian piety. Some scholars began calling for reforms within the Catholic Church, utilizing literature as a means of conveying their ideas. Erasmus, author of The Praise of Folly, used satire to reinforce what he considered true Christian values. Thomas More wrote Utopia as a critique of contemporary society. Despite their push for reform, they stopped well short of calling for a break with the Catholic Church, and it was Martin Luther who ultimately divided Christendom with his calls for reform. Martin Luther believed that painting and sculpture played some role in spreading the word of God, particularly among the illiterate populace who might find more meaning in the visual rather than in the printed word or elaborate sermons. He also favored the incorporation of music into church services, and he composed hymns personally for such purposes. Other Protestant leaders, most notably Huldrych Zwingli, believed that visual ornamentation and music detracted from the Gospel message. Music was eliminated from church services and organs were removed from churches. Zwingli favored simple church architecture devoid of ornamentation and images. John Calvin also disapproved of what he perceived as distracting ornamentation. He condemned attempts to humanize God through portraiture, believing it detracted from God’s omnipotence. Calvinism’s prevalence in the Netherlands led to the destruction of many sculptures and other visual images in formerly Catholic churches; instead, they were redesigned to reflect the Calvinist concept of austerity in order to eliminate distractions in the religious experience. The Catholic Church reaffirmed the importance of the arts at the Council of Trent in the mid-sixteenth century. It declared that likenesses of Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the saints encouraged veneration and that music and pictorial art promoted piety and furthered religious education.  Baroque art originated in Rome in the late sixteenth century. The movement was characterized by ornate styling, intense emotion, and freedom from restraint. The goals and beliefs of the Catholic Church (for example, the spiritual intervention of God and the saints in everyday life) were promoted through Baroque art. The Baroque movement’s ties to Catholicism during this period are exemplified in the architecture and decoration of such buildings as the Jesuit Church of Jesus in Rome. Bernini was among the principal artists of the period, executing a number of commissions for the Catholic Church, including the baldachin for St. Peter’s Basilica and religious sculpture such as the Ecstasy of St. Teresa. Rubens was the leading religious painter of the Catholic Reformation.  In music there was a similar divide between Protestant simplicity (e.g., vernacular hymns) and Catholic Baroque complexity, though this later broke down as many composers in Protestant areas also began working in the Baroque musical style. Bach is the best-known composer of this period. Both Protestants and Catholics used religious art for propaganda purposes. Woodcuts were an especially popular means to spread religious teachings as well as to condemn those of other religious groups. Protestant austerity can also be linked to greater use of woodcuts and engravings (as opposed to painting and illumination) to disseminate religious ideas. Albrecht Dürer gained fame in Germany for paintings and engravings known for their strong religious messages. Protestant emphasis on accessibility of the Bible led to an increase in literacy and an increase in the popularity of vernacular literature. General interest in religion and religious reform led to the increased popularity of such literary genres as popular devotional literature and spiritual autobiography. Access to such works was aided greatly by the development of the printing press. Protestant reforms led to the disappearance of Church patronage of the arts in many areas; artists were increasingly supported by the state or wealthy individuals. The loss of Catholic patronage, coupled with a rejection of artistic decoration in many Protestant churches, led to the development of painting by artists such as Rembrandt and Vermeer in northern Europe that catered to the private market. Such paintings were often smaller in scale and depicted ordinary activities, though they were still sometimes characterized by subtle spiritual messages. Analyze various ways in which government policies during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic era contributed to a greater sense of French national identity in the period 1789 to 1815. 9–8 points • Thesis is explicit and establishes linkages between government policies and national identity for both time periods. • Organization is clear, consistently followed, and effective in support of the argument. • Essay is well balanced, discussing both the French Revolution and Napoleonic periods, with well-developed linkages to national identity. • Includes two or more government policies from each era, with well-developed linkages to national identity. • May contain errors that do not detract from the argument. 7–6 points • Thesis is explicit and responsive to the question. • Organization is clear, is effective in support of the argument, but may not be consistently followed. • Essay is balanced, discussing both the Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods, with clear linkages to national identity. • Includes at least one government policy from each era, with clear linkages to national identity and some development of linkage. • May contain an error that detracts from the argument. 5–4 points • Thesis is explicit; thesis may not simply paraphrase the question, but linkages to national identity may be vague. • Organization is clear, is effective in support of the argument, but not be consistently followed. • Essay shows some imbalance; one of the two periods may be addressed superficially without clear linkage to national identity. • May develop the links between policy and identity well in one period or weakly in both periods. • May contain a few errors that detract from the argument. 3–2 points • Essay contains no explicit thesis or a thesis that merely repeats or paraphrases the prompt.  • Organization is unclear and ineffective. • Essay shows serious imbalance; may not address one of the periods with any relevant policies or linkage to national identity. • May have only one link between policies and national identity. • May contain several errors that detract from the argument. 1–0 points • There is no discernible attempt at a thesis. • Essay shows no discernible organization. • May be a narrative of the time periods, with no link to national identity. • Lacks relevant links between policies and national identity. • May contain numerous errors that detract from the argument. Question Analysis The phrase “government policies” is intended to mean exactly that: decisions or actions taken by the French national government. The storming of the Bastille and the women’s march on Versailles are not examples of policies leading to national identity. The prompt describes the process as one-directional — government’s impact on national identity. Essays may discuss any of the governments during the Revolutionary period but need not discuss all the governments. For example, one essay may link the policies of Louis XVI in 1789 to inspiring a sense of national unity against the government, while another may link the National Assembly’s Declaration of the Rights of Man to a rising sense of citizenship and national unity. The phrase “greater sense of French national identity” is intended to evoke the increasing likelihood of inhabitants of France thinking and acting as citizens of France rather than subjects of the monarchy or members of smaller groups (regional, corporate, civic identities, religious affiliations, etc.). Students might not have a sophisticated understanding of this concept, and few textbooks discuss it in depth. Essays that discuss emerging nationalism, national unity, feeling French (as opposed to feeling Catholic, for example), and other wording that clearly indicates that the student is linking government policies to a rising sense of identification with nation are all acceptable. Examples of Linkages Between Policies and Identity • Issuance of the Declaration of the Rights of Man establishes the government as the guarantor of individual rights and transforms inhabitants of France from subjects of the king to citizens of France. • Abolition of Old Regime privileges changes people’s relationship to the state; it becomes more uniform. • Wage and price controls (e.g., Le Chapelier Law, law of the maximum) establish government as the regulator of economy and protector of individuals’ economic interests. • Levee en masse creates a citizen army and theoretically mobilizes all citizens into service of France. End of aristocratic monopoly in the military officer corps leads to promotion based on merit and broader participation in the higher ranks of a national army. • Establishment of national festivals and the cult of the Supreme Being also promotes nationalism; government policies that weaken the independence of the Catholic Church (e.g., Civil Constitution of Clergy, closing of churches) weaken people’s attachment to a rival source of authority. Election of clergy also changes people’s relationship to the Church. • “Rationalization” of administrative divisions (départements) weakens regional identities. • Replacement of appointive offices with elective offices (mayor, departmental councils, judges, deputies, etc.) opens them to more citizens. • Standardization of weights and measures (metric system) also weakens local identities. • Napoleon’s promotion of state-run schools increases attachment to nation; teaching of standardized language breaks down local and regional identities. • The Concordat of 1801 allows people to be both Catholic and French. Peasants in particular can now be loyal to the Church without challenging government authority. • The Code Napoleon supersedes many local/regional laws and customs and reinforces national identity. • French victories during the Revolutionary period and conquests under Napoleon encourage national pride; Revolutionary ideals give French people the sense that they have a mission to spread these ideals. • Common enemies unite the French. Common enemies may be domestic (the Terror), foreign (the Coalitions, Britain, etc.), or both. Basic Question Timeline 1789 • May: Estates-General, Cahiers, and elections raise political consciousness. • June: National Assembly, Tennis Court Oath (1789–1791 Constituent Assembly). • July: Bastille, Great Fear. • August: Declaration of the Rights of Man, revocation of noble privilege, abolition of feudalism. • October: women’s march to Versailles. • National guard organized with elected officers — concept of the citizen soldier begins. 1790 • Nobles lose all privilege and become ordinary citizens. • Civil Constitution of the Clergy. 1791 • Constitution, June — king attempts to flee. • Provinces replaced with departments; economic unity — no internal tariffs, monopolies, guilds, workers’ associations, strikes; nationalized church property — issued assignats. 1792 • War with Austria, Prussia, and émigrés — volunteer army. • August — Parisians storm the Tuileries Palace; new elections held for a National Convention. • September — monarchy ends; Republic established. • Military victories occur and feudal privileges are abolished in conquered territories. 1793 • King guillotined. • Factions in Convention — Jacobins (Mountain) and Girondins, with the Plain in between. • Draft begun after Spain, Piedmont, and Britain join Prussia and Austria. • Law of the Maximum — price controls. • Committee of Public Safety — Reign of Terror begins. • Names of streets changed; new calendar, metric system, new religion introduced; central bank established. • August: levee en masse begins — all able-bodied single men between 18 and 25 are drafted. 1794 • Universal free primary education, for boys and girls, male and female teachers. • Army continues to grow—750,000 men by end of year. • June victories against Austria. • Economic mobilization on home front to support army. • July — Robespierre guillotined, terror ends, white terror begins. 1795 • Constitution of the Year III creates the Directory, 1795–1799. AP® EUROPEAN HISTORY 2012 SCORING GUIDELINES  Question 4 (continued) 1799–1815 • Coup of Brumaire; Napoleon centralizes power as first consul (lifetime first consul — 1802, emperor — 1804). • 1801 The Concordat restores the Church. • Civil Code (Napoleonic Code), meritocracy. • Third Coalition 1805–1812 victories, European domination, more conscription. • Continental System and naval war with Britain. • Napoleon defeated, Bourbons restored. Analyze the ways in which the rise of the middle class affected family structure and gender roles in Europe in the 1800s. 9–8 points • Thesis is explicit and fully responds to the question — refers to several ways in which middle-class family structure and gender roles changed in the 19th century. • Organization is clear and effectively supports the argument — body paragraphs develop the various ways family structure and gender roles changed as alluded to in the thesis. • Essay is well balanced — all topics required by the question are covered at length. • Uses elaborative evidence to support all major ideas regarding family structure and gender roles. • May contain an error or off-topic content that does not detract from the argument. 7–6 points • Thesis is explicit and responds to the terms of the question — may respond to family and gender issues less thoroughly. • Essay is organized and supports the argument but may stray off task — may merge gender roles and family structure issues into a single paragraph. • Both topics required by the question are covered at least briefly — some factors may be more developed than others. • Uses elaborative evidence to support most claims. • May contain an error or off-topic content that detracts from the argument. 5–4 points • Thesis is explicit but not fully responsive to the question — may refer to only one of the issues of family and gender. • Essay may deal with only one of the issues of family and gender. • Uses some elaborative evidence. • May contain a few errors that detract from the argument. 3–2 points • May contain no explicit, valid, or accurate thesis or is largely a paraphrase of the question. • Is poorly organized. • May fail to address most of the terms of the question in any substantial manner — may conflate middle-class and working-class families on the family and gender issue.

He adopted the concept of a defense-led economy (Wehrwirtschaft) and linked it to the national struggle. This belief implied that crucial resources outside Germany (e.g., oil) should be acquired by conquest rather than trade. Hitler further stated that acquiring the territory set aside in the Polish Corridor was vital to Germany’s ability to withstand any wartime blockades. The “struggle of nations” also meant that Hitler would never negotiate for a compromise peace once the war had begun. Mein Kampf was published in 1925. In it Hitler outlined the idea of Lebensraum, or living space, required for the German people; his racial theory characterized the Aryan race as predominant and other races (Poles, Slavs, Roma, Jews) as inferior. It articulated an idea of Germany’s destiny as Europe’s most powerful nation, a destiny achievable through the leadership and authority of the National Socialist (Nazi) Party. Hitler’s early speeches emphasized concern for sovereign equality andnational self-determination: although this originally meant self-determination for Germany (escaping Versailles’s restrictions), eventually the language was used to advocate self-determination for all Germans (those in the Saar, in Czechoslovakia, etc.). Rearmament occurred throughout the 1920s as Germany secretly rebuilt its military while still keeping to the letter of the Versailles restrictions. Hitler wanted to openly rebuild Germany’s military power: • 1933 — Army prepared to treble in size; Air Ministry built 1,000 planes; increased construction on military bases. Hitler withdrew from the Geneva Disarmament Conference when France would not agree to equal levels of armament with Germany. • 1935 — Hitler openly broke with Versailles Treaty, announced Germany’s rearmament, and subsequently mandated conscription for German men; the number of planes in Luftwaffe increased to 2,500; the Wehrmacht expanded to 300,000 men. Nazi ideology is authoritarian, stressing the importance of a single strong leader (Fuhrerprinzip). On an administrative level, Nazi Germany’s foreign policy was placed almost entirely in Hitler’s hands. Nazi ideology stressed German nationalism and the idea that all Germans should be under one state (Grossdeutschland); thus Hitler committed himself to occupation of all regions with significant German populations (Austria, Sudetenland). • 1935 — A plebiscite in the Saar region confirmed a desire for reunification with Germany. A Nazi-funded Czech Sudeten-German party was created that complained of discrimination against ethnic Germans. • 1938 — March: Hitler sent the army to occupy Austria (Anschluss); in September held Munich Conference (including England’s Neville Chamberlain, France’s Edouard Daladier, Italy’s Benito Mussolini). The Munich Compromise authorized Germany’s occupation of the Sudetenland. Czechoslovakia and the USSR were excluded. The following year Germany occupied the rest of Czechoslovakia. Anticommunism (anti-Bolshevism, anti-Judeo-Bolshevism) was central to Nazi ideology; thus Hitler saw eventual conflict with the Soviet Union as inevitable. • 1939 — Nazi-Soviet Pact was signed in August. Molotov for the USSR and von Ribbentrop for Germany agreed that each country would remain neutral if the other was involved in a war. • 1941— Operation Barbarossa: Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union included the “commissar order” to shoot Communist Party agents in the army, communist agitators, Bolshevik rebels, and Jews. The Einsatzgruppen (SS) was given specific orders to isolate, terrorize, and murder Jewish populations. Fascist Italy was seen as a natural partner and ally because of ideological similarities. Pact of Steel in 1939 committed Italy to supporting Germany in the event of a war and made the agreement that neither would negotiate a peace without the consent of the other. Support of the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War is also an example of ideology driving foreign policy. • 1936 — Germany signed a nonintervention agreement with regard to Spain but formed the Condor Legion (a combined air-army force), which aided the Nationalists from 1936 to 1939. • 1937 – Guernica was bombed by the Condor Legion. Support of quasi-fascist regimes in Eastern Europe and the Balkans (Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria) and for ethnic Germans in the Balkan countries (Volksdeutsche) led to formation of Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle (VoMi), or Ethnic German Aid Office, in 1935. Nazi racial ideology of Aryan superiority over non-Aryan Untermenschen encouraged Polish and Balkan conquests and the invasion of Russia, expulsions of non-Aryan populations in Eastern Europe, destruction of Polish intelligentsia, etc. The treatment of occupied countries in Western Europe was significantly less harsh, in part because of the ideological perception that Western European “races” were more akin to the Aryans. Anti-Semitism of Nazi ideology led to extermination of Jews in occupied countries (Holocaust). • 1935 — Nuremberg Laws deprived German Jews of citizenship, civil rights, and civil liberties (domestic). • 1937–1938 — Labor and concentration camps set up in Germany (Buchenwald, Flossenburg) (domestic).  • 1939 — Einsatzgruppen (SS) sent to Poland and USSR to find and murder Jews; ghettoes for Jews established in Poland; camps for detention, slave labor (e.g., Chelmno or Kulmhof) established. • 1941 — “Final Solution” adopted, camps created or adapted for use as extermination sites (e.g., Auschwitz-Birkenau, Belzec, Poznan in Poland); transit and detention camps established in France, the Netherlands, Italy, Ukraine, Croatia, and other occupied areas. Analyze various factors that contributed to the process of decolonization in the period 1914–1975. 9–8 points • Thesis identifies at least TWO factors that contributed to the process of decolonization in the period 1914–1975. Thesis may appear in the opening or the closing paragraph. • Organization is clear, consistently followed, and effective in support of the argument. • Provides effective analysis of at least TWO factors; may focus on the process of decolonization for only ONE European empire OR a single non-European region. • All major assertions are supported by specific pieces of relevant evidence. • May contain errors that do not detract from the argument. 7–6 points • Thesis refers to at least TWO factors. • Organization is clear, effective in support of the argument, but not consistently followed • Essay provides some analysis of at least TWO factors, possibly unevenly. • All major assertions are supported by some relevant evidence. • May contain an error that detracts from the argument. 5–4 points • Thesis includes possible factors OR may identify ONE factor. • Organization supports the argument. • Essay may be primarily descriptive rather than analytical. • Some evidence is included. • May contain a few errors that detract from the argument. 3–2 points • Thesis may be vague OR merely repeat or paraphrase the prompt. • Organization is unclear and ineffective. • Essay is merely descriptive and may be off task. • Minimal evidence is provided. • May contain several errors that detract from the argument. 1–0 points • Thesis may not be supported or may be erroneous or missing. • No discernible organization. • Argument is off task or missing. • Little or no supporting evidence is provided. • May contain numerous errors that detract from the argument. Possible Periodization • First World War, interwar period, Second World War (1914–1945) • Post-1945 era Context: The New Imperialism • Between 1870 and 1914 (some sources cite the 1880s), European political expansion brought much of the rest of the world under its direct control. Motives are usually identified as economic (raw materials, foreign markets, places for capital investment), geopolitical (protection of vital lanes of communication and transport), and sociocultural (Europe’s so-called civilizing mission to Social Darwinist assertions that superior races have the right to test themselves on the field of honor). • Some authors acknowledge resistance to European rule prior to the First World War. Others note that most people accepted rule by a small elite, a practice quite common before the arrival of Europeans. Anti-European movements often were divided into traditionalists who rejected the idea that Europe had something to teach the colonies versus modernizers who advocated a selective adoption of Western lifestyles and values. Between the World Wars (1914–1945) • Some colonial powers employed soldiers and laborers from the colonies during the First World War in Europe and other theaters of war. One textbook indicates that one million Africans, one million Indians, and one million soldiers from British dominions fought in the Great War. • Some imperial powers encouraged colonial subjects of their rivals to revolt against their rulers. The most common example is the Arab Uprising against the Ottoman government. • Either the British and French promised greater political authority to colonials or colonials expected greater political sovereignty in exchange for their support of the European imperial power — expectations that were not satisfied in the postwar era. • Paris Peace Settlements (1919–1923): o Colonial aspirations were in part inspired by Woodrow Wilson’s 14 Points and its support of the principle of self-determination.  o The winners of the war established the mandate system in the lands of the defeated Central Powers. The Middle East mandates are described most often; textbooks describe them either as relatively quiet or as turbulent. o The empires of Britain and France were larger than before the First World War, but some textbooks point out that such empires now faced greater challenges to their authority. • The interwar period (1919–1939) receives very uneven coverage in the textbooks. India demanded independence from European rule, Japan challenged Western interests in East Asia, and at least one textbook also notes the rise of anti-imperialism in Asia and Africa during the 1920s and 1930s. Gandhi led a nonviolent protest movement against British rule in the interwar period; Ho Chi Minh led a violent but unsuccessful peasant uprising in Indochina.  • The Japanese expansion into Southeast Asia during the Second World War came at the expense of the Western European empires like Britain and France. Japan justified its agenda on the grounds that Asia should be controlled by Asians. In reality the Japanese exploited the indigenous population for their own ends. The Japanese success, however, undermined Western prestige in Asia. Post-1945 Era and Decolonization • Imperial collapse in Africa and Asia after 1945 occurred rapidly. Textbooks identify a variety of factors for the relatively rapid pace of decolonization: the loss of Western power, the intensified demand by African and Asian peoples for self-determination, concerns in the metropole over the cost of empire, the discrepancy between Western rhetoric regarding basic rights and its application into policy, efforts by the Cold War superpowers to extend their global influence. The texts sometimes offer a contrast between British and French decolonization. • South and Southeast Asia — India, Indochina, Indonesia: o British authorities negotiated an end to imperial control in India. Despite Gandhi’s opposition, the region’s religious and ethnic divisions resulted in the partition of the subcontinent into two nation-states, India and Pakistan, with Pakistan itself later splitting into two states (present-day Pakistan and Bangladesh). Some textbooks note that partition proved violent and bloody. o Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh proclaimed Vietnam’s independence in 1945 but were forced to fight a war against the colonial power, France. Military defeat at Dien Bien Phu compelled French recognition of Vietnamese independence at the Geneva Conference in 1954. o The Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) receives little treatment aside from an occasional reference to the violent expulsion of the Dutch (1945–1949).    • The Middle East and North Africa: o A number of texts identify the region as an arena for confrontation by the Cold War superpowers. o Britain surrendered control of Palestine to the United Nations. The state of Israel was proclaimed in 1948, setting the stage for a number of wars between Israel and its Arab neighbors. As a result, the national aspirations of the peoples of the region became entangled in the political agendas of the Cold War superpowers. o Egypt, a British protectorate for part of the early 20th century, challenged European authority in 1956 when its president, Gamal Abdel Nasser, nationalized the Suez Canal. The British and French invaded Egypt but were forced to back down by the open hostility of the American and Soviet governments, an indication of European weakness in the age of the superpowers. o An Algerian nationalist movement (the FLN) was established in 1954 and won independence after a vicious war characterized by acts of brutality and terrorism by both sides. French President Charles de Gaulle gradually negotiated French withdrawal from the colony in 1962. • Sub-Saharan Africa: o Coverage of the process of decolonization for sub-Saharan Africa is uneven.  o Kenya is sometimes contrasted with Ghana (violence vs. nonviolence), but limited analysis is offered. Some authors comment on the fact that decolonization in sub-Saharan Africa proved a relatively smooth transition. o Less common are references to the loss of the Portuguese empire (Angola and Mozambique) and the Belgian Congo.
