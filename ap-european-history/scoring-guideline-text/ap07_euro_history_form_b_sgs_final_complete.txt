Provides an appropriate, explicitly stated thesis that directly addresses all parts of the question. Thesis may not simply restate the question.  The thesis must suggest a minimal level of analysis or context (drawn from the documents). It need not appear in the first paragraph. 2. Discusses a majority of the documents individually and specifically. The student must use at least seven documents—even if used incorrectly—by reference to anything in the box. Documents cannot be referenced together in order to get credit for this point (e.g., “Documents 1, 4, and 6 suggest …”). Documents need not be cited by number or by name. 3. Demonstrates understanding of the basic meaning of a majority of the documents (may misinterpret no more than one). A student may not significantly misinterpret more than one document. A major misinterpretation is an incorrect analysis or one that leads to an inaccurate grouping or a false conclusion. Generally, errors in attempts to use point of view should not be judged as major errors. 4. Supports the thesis with appropriate interpretations of a majority of the documents. The student must use at least seven documents, and the documents used in the body of the essay must provide support for the thesis. A student cannot earn this point if no credit was awarded for item 1 (appropriate thesis). 5. Analyzes point of view or bias in at least three documents. The student must make a reasonable effort to explain why a particular source expresses the stated view by • Relating authorial point of view to author’s place in society (motive, position, status, etc.) OR • Evaluating the reliability of the source OR • Recognizing that different kinds of documents serve different purposes OR • Analyzing the tone of the documents; must be well developed Note: (1) Attribution alone is not sufficient to earn credit for point of view. (2) It is possible for students to discuss point of view collectively (e.g., La Primaudaye and Molière taken together), but this counts for only one point of view. 6. Analyzes documents by explicitly organizing them into at least three appropriate groups. A group must contain at least two documents that are used correctly. Examples of possible (not exclusive) groupings include the following: Nobility as birthright (3, 9, 11, 12) Nobility as burden (1, 4) Nobility as virtue (2, 4, 6, 8) Nobility bestowed (1, 4, 7, 11) Nobles as soldiers (1, 5, 11) Behavior vs. birth (2, 8) “False” nobles (5, 12) Money issues (1, 4, 11) Parliament related (3, 7) Authorship: sword noblemen (1, 2, 4, 9, 11) Authorship: kings (6, 10) Authorship: “others” (3, 5, 7, 8, 12, all non-nobles) Time periods (sixteenth century: 1–3; seventeenth century: 4–10; eighteenth century: 11–12) EXPANDED CORE: 0–3 points to a total of 9 points Expands beyond the basic core of 1–6. The basic score of 6 must be achieved before a student can earn expanded core points. Credit awarded in the expanded core should be based on holistic assessment of the essay.
