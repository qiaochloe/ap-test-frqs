Provides an appropriate, explicitly stated thesis that directly addresses all parts of the question. Thesis must not simply restate the question.   The thesis must addresses at least two views of immigration and at least make an acknowledgment of change over time.  2. Discusses a majority of the documents individually and specifically.     The essay must discuss at least seven documents — even if used incorrectly — by reference to anything in the box. For an essay to earn credit for this point, it cannot reference documents collectively (e.g., “Documents 2, 3 and 6 suggest … ”) unless they are then discussed individually.  3. Demonstrates understanding of the basic meaning of a majority of the documents.   The essay may not significantly misinterpret more than 1 document. A major misinterpretation is an incorrect analysis or one that leads to an inaccurate grouping. This point cannot be earned if the essay did not earn point 2 (discusses at least seven documents).  4. Supports the thesis with appropriate interpretations of a majority of the documents.    The essay must use at least seven documents correctly, and the documents used in the body of the essay must provide support for the thesis. This point cannot be earned if no credit was awarded for point 1 (appropriate thesis).  5. Analyzes point of view or bias in at least three of the documents.    Look for an explanation as to the “why” for the point of view; hence look for catchwords (because, due to, therefore, etc.).   6. Analyzes documents by explicitly organizing them in at least three appropriate groups.    A group must have at least two documents. If one document out of a group of two is incorrect, there no longer is a group. Some possible valid groupings include the following:  • Hostile views of politicians or political parties: documents 2, 9 • Positive views of politicians or political parties: documents 6, 7, 12 • Positive views of immigrants themselves: documents 1, 5, 11 • Justice, equality, liberty, human rights: documents 6, 8, 12 • Ambivalent or negative views of immigrants, being in exile, racism/hatred:  documents 1, 4, 5, 8, 10 • Cultural differences acknowledged or decried: documents 4, 5, 7, 8 Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  EXPANDED CORE: 0–3 points to a total of 9 points Expands beyond the basic core points 1 through 6 outlined above. The basic score of 6 must be achieved before a student can earn expanded core points. Credit awarded in the expanded core should be based on holistic assessment of the essay. Factors to consider in holistic assessment may include the following:  • Presents a clear, analytical and comprehensive thesis. • Uses eight or more documents. • Uses the documents persuasively as evidence. • Shows understanding of nuances of the documents. • Analyzes point of view or bias in at least four documents. • Analyzes the documents in additional ways (e.g., develops more groupings). • Brings in relevant outside information. Question 2  Describe the challenges to royal authority in eastern Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and evaluate the
