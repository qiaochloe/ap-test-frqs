Italy should be a republic because it really has no basis for existing as a monarchy (pro-republic, anti-monarchy). Document 2: Carlo Cattaneo, philosopher and political activist, Lombardy, 1836 Whoever ignores this love of the individual regions of Italy will always build on sand (pro-region, anti-unity). Document 3: Vincenzo Gioberti, priest from Piedmont, On the Moral and Civil Primacy of the Italians, published in exile, 1843 That the pope is naturally, and should be effectively, the civil head of Italy is a truth forecast in the nature of things and confirmed by many centuries of history. Would increase the strength of the various princes (pro-pope, pro-unity). Document 4: Count Camillo Benso di Cavour, politician from Piedmont-Sardinia, journal article, 1846 All true friends of the country must recognize that they cannot truly help their fatherland except by gathering in support of legitimate monarchs who have their roots in the national soil (anti-unity, pro-monarchy, pro-region). Document 5: Pope Pius IX, published statement, 1848 The Italian people should abide in close attachment to their respective sovereigns, of whose goodwill they have already had experience, so as never to let themselves be torn away from the obedience they owe them (pro-monarchy, pro-region, anti-unity). Document 6: Daniele Manin, politician from Venice, letter to a friend, 1848 Peoples who have different origins and customs should not be forced together, because otherwise civil war will follow the war of independence (pro-region, anti-unity, anti-independence). Document 7: Marquis Massimo d’Azeglio, politician from Piedmont, secretly printed pamphlet, 1856 But ask any Italian, north or south, whether or not it is useful for Italy to free itself from foreign domination and influence, and no one, thank God, will reply other than in the affirmative, no one will refuse to give their minds or their hands to this end (pro-independence). Document 8: Count Camillo Benso di Cavour, prime minister of Piedmont-Sardinia, letter to Victor Emmanuel, king of Piedmont-Sardinia, 1858 The Emperor [Napoleon III, emperor of the French] readily agreed that it was necessary to drive the Austrians out of Italy once and all. But how was Italy to be organized after that? (pro-independence, pro-region). Question 1 — Document Summary (continued) Document 9: Jessie White Mario, English journalist, letter to the editor, The New York Times, 1858 Every inch of ground won by Italians for Italy in 1848 and 1849 was won by republicans, and at the close of that year Italy would have been free from foreigners, would have been free, independent and united, had not monarchy stepped in and substituted the petty longings of dynastic ambition for the great national aim (pro-independence, pro-republican, anti-monarchy). Document 10: Peace of Villafranca, treaty between France and Austria, 1859 The Emperors of Austria and France will favor the creation of an Italian Confederation and the honorary presidency of the pope (pro-pope, pro-region). Document 11: Emperor Napoleon III of France, letter to an Italian friend, 1859 I do not wish to see Italy united. I want only independence (anti-unity, pro-independence). Document 12: Giuseppe Garibaldi, representing Caprera in the Italian parliament, 1868 Although old republicans in principles and deeds, I and my friends accepted the monarchy in good faith, and asked of it nothing other than that it improve the conditions of our poor people (pro-monarchy). A closer look at DBQ thesis and point-of-view statements Examples of viable theses: • For many Italians the debate was one not of national unification, but rather of national liberation. • Underlying it all would be the debate of unification, whether Italy should emerge into the 20th century as a single unified nation, or simply as a confederation of individual constituents bound only by geographical destiny and religious conformity. • National liberation and national identity were far more important to most Italians than national unification. Examples of what would not count as a thesis: • Italy was divided politically and culturally well into the 19th century. • The pope was generally opposed to Italian unification. Examples of attribution: • Giuseppe Mazzini was an attorney from Genoa exiled from Piedmont in 1831. • Napoleon III was the emperor of France. • Vincenzo Gioberti was a priest from Piedmont who wrote On the Moral and Civil Primacy of the Italians in 1836. Examples of point of view: • As the context is in a letter to the New York Times appealing to American readers, such an audience might support such emotions of national unity and independence. Because of this, the letter was written probably more in an attempt to garnish audience support than in an effort to be politically accurate (Doc. 9). • The fact that Mazzini penned these words when he was in exile shows that the unification of Italy was something he really believed in, making the document a reliable source in its intent (Doc. 1). Question 1 — Document Summary (continued) •  Napoleon III was the emperor of the Second Empire and primarily interested in the security of France, he obviously would be opposed to the creation of a new state that would disrupt the balance of power in Europe (Doc. 11). • Because Vincenzo Gioberti was a prince of the Church and thus a loyal follower of the pope, Gioberti would naturally appeal to the Holy See as the means for Italian unification as opposed to a secular monarch (Doc. 3). Question 2 Compare and contrast the economic and social development of Russia with that of the Netherlands in the period 1600–1725. 9–8 Points • The thesis is clearly stated and compares and contrasts Russia with the Netherlands.  • The organization is clear. • The essay is well balanced and deals with EITHER economic OR social development in BOTH Russia and the Netherlands. • Assertions in the essay are supported by at least TWO pieces of relevant evidence and historical specificity. • The essay makes connections between economic factors and social factors. • The essay may contain some errors. 7–6 Points • The thesis is clearly stated and compares and contrasts Russia with the Netherlands. • The essay is well balanced and deals with EITHER economic OR social development in BOTH Russia and the Netherlands. • Assertions in the essay are supported by at least ONE piece of relevant evidence or historical specificity. • The essay makes connections between economic factors and social factors.  • The essay may contain some errors. 5–4 Points • The thesis is clearly stated but uneven OR just restates the question. It tends to focus too much on similarities OR too much on differences OR too much on Russia OR too much on the Netherlands. • The organization is unbalanced and not necessarily very effective. • Assertions tend to be general statements supported by only ONE piece of evidence. • The historical narrative is mostly factual with little analysis. • The essay may contain minor errors that do not get in the way of the argument. 3–2 Points • There is no thesis or the thesis just restates the question. • The organization is unclear and ineffective. • The essay shows serious and major imbalance. • Statements are superficial and general without any factual support. • There is little historical specificity for analysis. • There is little or no analysis. • The essay contains major errors that detract from the argument. Question 2 (continued) 1–0 Points • There is no thesis. • The essay is poorly organized. • The essay is off task and nonresponsive to the question. • The discussion is irrelevant. • The argument is general, superficial, vague and simplistic. • There is little or no supporting evidence. • There is no analysis or historical connections. • Major errors get in the way of the argument  Question 2 — Historical Background Notes The purpose of this question is to investigate the similarities and differences in Dutch and Russian socioeconomic development from 1600 to 1725. Though the time parameter begins in 1600, the majority of the essays will focus primarily on the periods after 1648 in the Netherlands and after 1689 in Russia. The year 1725 saw the death of Peter the Great, so this is a clue as to the focus of many of the essays. There are obviously more profound differences than there are similarities between the Dutch Republic and Russia. For this reason the essays will appear somewhat unbalanced, focusing more on contrasting than on comparing. In the spirit of the prompt, however, essays that receive scores in the higher ranges must both compare and contrast. In the 17th century four common themes characterized both the Dutch Republic and Russia: • Both were faced with the challenge of restive nobility. • Both were struggling to finance massive military expenditures. • Both were trying to make their economies modern to compete with powerful neighbors. • Both were experimenting with ways to increase government revenues.  Because of the common fiscal issues similar to both countries, discussion of similarities will focus much more on economic issues than on social issues. On closer examination, the Dutch Republic and Russia were far more different than they were similar: • Russia had a relatively large noble class — 7 percent of the population; the nobility in Holland was restricted primarily to two thousand families out of a population of roughly two million.  • Russia was desperately trying to domesticate a large and dangerous boyar class; the primary challenge to the Dutch government from the nobility was found in the States General. • Peter the Great was trying to transform the Russian service nobility from a social class based on blood to an aristocracy based on merit; the nobility of the Netherlands was defined by commercial excellence. • Russia was clamping down on its serfs after numerous Cossack and agrarian revolts; serfdom in the Netherlands had disappeared almost two centuries earlier.  • Russia was a rigidly stratified society divided between noble and serf; the Dutch Republic was socially much more fluid and dynamic. • Women in Russia were a major source of labor; women in the Dutch Republic were beginning to emerge as a truly modern class of leisure.  • There was no commercial class in Russia; the middle class in the Netherlands was what virtually defined the country. • Russia was primarily agricultural; the Netherlands was the world’s leader in commerce and mercantilist polices.  • Russia was frozen in a backwater of medieval agricultural practices; the Netherlands was the world’s economic leader.  • Russia was trying to secularize the Church and rein in the Old Believers; the Dutch Reformed Church had been an institution of religious toleration for over a century. Question 3 Assess the ways in which women participated in and influenced TWO of the following: the Renaissance; the Reformation; the French Revolution. 9–8 Points • The essay provides a sophisticated thesis that addresses TWO historical periods and addresses either participation OR influence. • The organization is clear. • The essay is well balanced and deals with TWO historical periods and TWO ways women either participated in OR influenced each period. This might be a combination of ONE way they participated in and ONE way they influenced the period, for a total of TWO. • All major assertions are supported by MULTIPLE pieces of relevant evidence. • The essay may contain minor errors. 7–6 Points • The essay provides a good thesis that addresses TWO historical periods and addresses either participation OR influences. • The organization is clear. • The essay is well balanced and deals with TWO historical periods and ONE way women either participated in OR influenced each period. • Assertions are supported by at least TWO pieces of evidence. • The essay may contain minor errors. 5–4 Points • The essay provides an adequate thesis that is clearly stated but uneven OR the thesis restates the question. • The organization is unbalanced and not necessarily effective. The essay tends to focus just on the Reformation OR just on the Renaissance OR just on the French Revolution. • Major assertions are supported by at least ONE piece of evidence. • The essay tends to read as factual narrative with little analysis. • The essay may contain minor errors. 3–2 Points • The essay provides no thesis or just restates the question. • The organization is unclear and ineffective. • The essay shows serious imbalance. • Statements are superficial, vague and general. • There is little historical proof or evidence. • The essay may contain several errors that detract from the argument. 1–0 Points • The essay provides no thesis. • The organization is poor. • The essay is off task and irrelevant. • There is little or no supporting evidence. • The essay contains major errors. Question 3 — Historical Background Notes This question is enormously challenging. Because of the topic, students will react to the prompt more in general themes than with specific pieces of evidence. Although all the major texts discuss women in these three periods, the context tends to be more comparative, addressing the change of relative themes over time. Students must deal with TWO periods in a balanced fashion. General theme for the Renaissance: Though hardly the majority of the female population, well-to-do girls in the cities of the Renaissance Italy received an education similar to boys. Renaissance humanism represented a real educational advance for aristocratic women. Young ladies learned their letters and studied the classics. Many read Greek and Latin, knew the poets Ovid and Virgil, and could speak one or two “modern” languages such as French or Spanish. Although Renaissance aristocratic women were better educated than their medieval counterparts, their educations prepared them for the social life at home. A notable feature of smaller Renaissance courts was the important role played by women who often ruled side by side with their husbands. If, however, the Renaissance is often said to have discovered mankind in general, this meant for the most part, men. The Church still considered women to be sinful daughters of Eve. Because of strict gender divisions within the Church and within Renaissance society, women could not aspire to holiness and sainthood. The Renaissance did not bring about any significant loosening in the restrictions placed on women. For this reason, women’s contributions during the Renaissance tended to be the exception rather than the rule. A tiny minority of women among humanists acquired great learning and fame. For example, in the later 16th century at least 25 women published books in Italy. • Christine de Pisan (1363–1434) — a highly educated woman who wrote prolifically in French, her native language. Her patron was the queen of France. Christine wrote The Book of the City of Ladies, which focuses not on the behavior of all French women, but just on women of the Court. • Sofonisba Anguissola (1530–1625) and Artemisia Gentileschi (1593–1653) — achieved international renown for their oil paintings. • Isabella Andreini (1562–1604) — enjoyed the reputation as the most famous actress of her day. • Laura Creta (1469–1499) — a famous Italian humanist educated by her father. She was known for her scathing letters addressing the status of women in her own society. She argued that women’s inferiority was derived not from God but from women themselves. Creta’s provocative thesis earned her the wrath of men and women alike. Her most famous work was Defense of the Liberal Instruction of Women, widely attacked by the Italian clergy. Question 3 — Historical Background Notes (continued) • Isabella d’Estes (1474–1539) — famous for her passionate quest to assemble the best artists of Italy, including painters, poets and musicians. She was called the “first lady of the world.” D’Estes pursued both Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci. Her numerous letters to friends, family, princes and artists all over Europe reveal her political savvy as well as her good sense of humor. Both before and after the death of her husband, she effectively ruled Mantua and won a reputation as a clever negotiator. • Battista Sforza (1442–1482) — second wife of the famous condottiere Federigo da Montefeltro, the duke of Urbino. Because her husband was frequently absent waging wars, Sforza often ruled Urbino “with firmness and good sense.” General theme for the Reformation: Overall the Protestant Reformation did not noticeably transform women’s subordinate place in society. Because Protestantism had eliminated any idea of special holiness for celibacy, abolishing both monasticism and a celibate clergy, the family was placed at the center of human life, and a new stress on “mutual love between man and wife” was extolled. Luther’s argument that all vocations had equal merit in the sight of God gave dignity to the women of the home who performed ordinary, routine and domestic tasks. The Christian home, in contrast to the place of business, became the place of the gentler virtues: love, tenderness, reconciliation, the carrying of one another’s burdens. The Protestant abolition of private confession to a priest freed women from possibly embarrassing explorations of their sexual lives. Protestants established schools where girls as well as boys became literate in the catechism and the Bible. Luther was confident that God took delight in the sexual act and denied that original sin affected the goodness of creation. That being said, however, he believed that marriage was a woman’s career. In their effort to create order and discipline, Protestant reformers denounced sexual immorality and glorified the family. Calvin’s earliest significant converts were women, whose patronage helped his faith take root at the highest levels of society. More women than men converted to Calvinism in France, perhaps because their legal position was deteriorating — for example, with regard to their dowries and possessions. On a darker note, women became unwilling participants in the great witch hunts during the Reformation. Most women who were accused of being witches were rural, poor, and single; many had just inherited property.  They often confronted the hostility of other villagers, particularly local officials and wealthy peasants. Women were also targets of repression during the Reformation because they were transmitters of the collective memory of popular culture. For centuries the Catholic hierarchy had regarded women as the source of sin, a notion that remained popular even as the great reformers were changing European faith. • Catherine of Aragon (1529) — instrumental in sparking the beginning of the English Reformation, generating the debate for papal dispensation from the biblical law that prohibited a union between a man and his brother’s widow. • Elizabeth Dirks (1549) — interrogated in the Netherlands for her role in advocating gender equality, especially in the realm of church roles and the interpretation of Holy Scripture. • Katharina Zell (1534) — wife of the Strasbourg reformer Matthew Zell who defended her gender equality by citing a Bible verse to attack a critic who demanded that women remain silent in church. • Katharina von Bora (1525) — wife of Martin Luther who gave her husband complete devotion and support during his crusade to reform the Church. Von Bora was Luther’s model for the perfect wife “managing the house and home.” Question 3 — Historical Background Notes (continued) General theme for the French Revolution: A perplexing question arose from the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of September 1789: Whom did the Declaration mean by “man and citizen”? The laws that excluded women from voting and holding office did not pass unnoticed. In 1791 Olympe de Gouges, a butcher’s daughter from Montauban in northwest France who became a major revolutionary radical in Paris, composed a Declaration of the Rights of Women, which she ironically addressed to Queen Marie-Antoinette. Much of the document reprinted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, adding the word “woman” to the various original clauses. De Gouges’ declaration illustrated how the simple listing of rights in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen created a structure of universal civic expectations even for those it did not cover. In unprecedented numbers, women took up the pen to publish pamphlets and journals. Their physical presence in public spaces was even more dramatic. Despite the importance of women to the revolutionary cause, male revolutionaries, especially the Jacobin radicals, reacted disdainfully to female participation in political activity. This was especially true during the radical phase of the revolution with the destruction of the Girondin moderates after 1793. With the onset of the Terror in 1793–1794, the Convention and later the Committee for Public Safety turned on the women of Paris. Women demanding radical change were labeled as public enemies and counterrevolutionary. The lofty ideals of de Gouges were simply too radical for the Jacobin ruling elite, committed to security and the maintenance of political power. • Marianne — female icon who became the symbol of the Revolution and the Republic. Since la liberté is a feminine term in French, liberty and the ideals associated with the revolution were often associated with female virtues. • Marie-Antoinette (1753–1793) — the public disdain for Louis XVI’s unpopular wife galvanized public opinion against the Bourbon monarchy. She was guillotined in 1793 as an unwilling participant in the French Revolution. • October 1789 — Women’s March to Versailles demanding a lowering of bread prices. The female mob returned to Paris with the king and the royal family. • Olympe de Gouges (1789–1793) — wrote The Declaration of the Rights of Women in 1791; guillotined in 1793 by the radical Jacobins intent on maintaining social control. • Charlotte Corday (July 1793) — Girondin moderate who assassinated Marat and was guillotined by the Jacobins in July 1793. • Pauline Léon and Claire Lacombe — founded the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women in May, 1793. The society became ultraradical, demanding the lowering of food prices and hunger relief for the poor of Paris. It was shut down by the Jacobins in October 1793, resulting in the arrest and imprisonment of both of its founders. Both remained in Jacobin jails throughout 1794, and both survived their ordeals. Question 4 Analyze the ways in which the two works, Perugino’s Christ Delivering the Keys of the Kingdom to Saint Peter (1481–1483) and Michelangelo’s David (1501–1504), represent the values of Italian Renaissance culture. 9–8 Points • The essay provides a sophisticated thesis that is clearly stated and addresses BOTH pieces of art and Renaissance cultural values. • The organization is clear. • The essay is well balanced and connects BOTH Perugino and Michelangelo to at least TWO or more Renaissance values. • All major assertions in the essay are supported by MULTIPLE pieces of relevant evidence. • The essay may contain some errors that do not detract from the argument. 7–6 Points • The essay provides a good thesis that is clearly stated and addresses BOTH pieces of art and Renaissance cultural values. • The organization is clear and effective. • The essay is well balanced with BOTH Perugino and Michelangelo connected to at least ONE Renaissance value. • Assertions in the essay are supported by at least TWO pieces of evidence. • The essay may contain minor errors. 5–4 Points • The essay provides an adequate thesis that is clearly stated but uneven, OR the thesis restates the question. • The organization is unbalanced and not necessarily effective. The essay tends to focus on Perugino and ONE or more Renaissance values or focuses primarily on Michelangelo and ONE or more Renaissance value. • The primary focus of the essay is on Renaissance values with little or no application of the pieces of art to these values. • Major assertions are supported by at least ONE piece of evidence. • The essay tends to read as factual narrative with little analysis. • The essay may contain minor errors. 3–2 Points • The essay provides no thesis or just restates the question. • The organization is unclear and ineffective. • The essay shows serious imbalance.  • Statements are superficial, vague and general. • The essay contains little historical proof or evidence. • The essay may contain several errors that detract from the argument. AP® EUROPEAN HISTORY 2010 SCORING GUIDELINES (Form B) Question 4 (continued) 1–0 Points • The essay provides no thesis. • The essay is poorly organized. • The essay is off task and irrelevant. • There is little or no supporting evidence. • The essay contains major errors. Question 4 — Historical Background Notes This question is straightforward in delivering its task, asking students to tie two differing art types (painting and sculpture) to the values of the Italian Renaissance. Each of the noted texts makes an effort to discuss this topic at some length. The texts address the basic values of the Italian Renaissance as being: • humanism (some refer to it as “Christian” humanism) — the art of studying the classics left by the Greeks and the Romans to learn what they revealed about human nature. Humanism emphasized human beings and their achievements, interests and capabilities. Those texts that refer to Christian humanism add the concept of using the classics to reveal their prophetic meanings toward Christianity. • individualism — the attitude of stressing personality, unique genius and full development of one’s capabilities and talents. Individualism includes a thirst for fame, the quest for glory, a driving ambition and a burning desire for success. • secularism — focus on the material world instead of the eternal world of spirit. Secular thinking tends to find the ultimate explanation of everything and the final end of human beings within the limits of what the senses can discover. Secularism places heavy emphasis on the here and now. Within a framework of the noted values, two works of art are offered as models to show how the people of the times interpreted these ideas in their daily lives. Renaissance humanists used their knowledge and love of the classic to influence their poetry, historical views and philosophy. All the texts note individuals such as Petrarch (law, language and poetry), Quirini (demeaned the Turks and the East while praising the works of the Greeks and Romans), and Pico (saw man as able to master his world while rising to near angelic status). These men and others brought religious piety and patriotism to a shifting world. The texts note that the established Church was losing temporal power, and both of the works of art presented for consideration clearly demonstrate a secular rise at the expense of the Church. The age saw a shifting of power from religious leaders to individual and secular leaders. Most texts reference Cesare Borgia’s military and political aid to Pope Alexander VI along with ties to Machiavelli. Italian politics demonstrated the ability of powerful men (families), such as the Medici and Sforza, to dominate the weaker entities of their times. Individuals such as Savonarola are shown to utilize individualism to show high morals, while Alberti, Vasari, Castiglione and Cellini demonstrate distinctive personalities and talents that lie outside traditional Church-held values left over from the medieval period. What is necessary is that students recognize the traditional Renaissance values and link them to the works of art utilizing the abundant examples provided by the texts. Note: Several of the texts mention that “religious” ideas of the Italian Renaissance extend to the Reformation. Thus students may tend to drift into this time frame with their references. However, they must not lose focus, and the terms of the question clearly state Italian Renaissance. Question 5 Analyze the political and economic effects of changing population patterns in Western Europe in the period circa 1950 to the present. Cite specific examples from at least TWO countries. 9–8 Points • The essay provides a sophisticated thesis that addresses EITHER political effects OR economic effects in TWO European countries. • The organization is clear and effective. • The essay is well balanced between TWO European countries. • The essay clearly connects changing population patterns to political OR economic effects. • All major assertions in the essay are supported by at least TWO pieces of relevant evidence from at least TWO different countries. • The essay may contain minor errors. 7–6 Points • The essay provides a good thesis that addresses EITHER political effects OR economic effects in TWO European countries. • The organization is clear and effective. • The essay clearly connects changing population patterns to political OR economic effects. • All major assertions in the essay are supported by at least ONE piece of relevant evidence from at least TWO specific countries. • The essay may contain minor errors. 5–4 Points • The essay provides an adequate thesis that is clearly stated but uneven. It tends to focus too much on a single country OR just restates the question. • The organization is unbalanced and not very effective. The essay feels like a German political paper or a Dutch economic paper. • The essay struggles with the connections between changing populations and political OR economic effects. • The essay contains mostly general statements without any reference to any individual countries. • Assertions are supported by at least ONE piece of evidence. • The narrative is mostly factual with little analysis and little sense of connections. • The essay may contain minor errors. 3–2 Points • The essay provides no thesis or just restates the question. • The organization is unclear and ineffective. • The essay shows serious imbalance. • The essay makes little or no connection between changing population patterns and political and economic effects. • The essay is off task with irrelevant material. • Statements are superficial, vague and general. • There is little historical proof or evidence, and the essay never mentions a single European country. • The narrative is all factual with no analysis or connections. • The essay may contain several errors that detract from the argument. AP® EUROPEAN HISTORY 2010 SCORING GUIDELINES (Form B) Question 5 (continued) 1–0 Points • The essay provides no thesis. • The organization is poor. • The essay is off task and nonresponsive to the question. • Irrelevant material is provided. • There is little or no evidence of any understanding. • No factual evidence is presented. • There are no connections and no analysis. • The essay may contain numerous errors that detract from the argument. Question 5 — Historical Background Notes For the average AP European History student, this question may be challenging for two reasons. First, the time parameter is post-1950, hence modern European history, a time period many AP classes struggle to reach by the end of the year. Second, the topic in the majority of the texts is covered in general themes, for example, “postwar immigration.” Because of this, only the very good essays will have the sophistication to reference individual examples for specific countries. Postwar Europe witnessed widespread migration and immigration patterns. This fell into roughly two general periods: 1950–1970 and following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. • West Asian — Pakistani and Indian — immigrants arrived in the British Isles following the establishment of India and Pakistan in 1947. The arrival of West Asian immigrants was followed by a wave of immigrants from the British Caribbean. • The arrival of Turkish, Italian and Greek Gastarbeiter (guest workers) in West Germany in the 1950s and 1960s helped transform the Federal Republic, resulting in the Wirstschaftswunder (economic miracle) of the 1970s. By 1970 the second largest Turkish city in the world was Berlin. • The Pieds Noirs (black feet) phenomenon arose in France as tens of thousands of Algerians and North Africans migrated to France following the Algerian War of Independence, 1954–1962. Most North African immigrants arrived in France after 1967. France currently has the largest Muslim population in Western Europe. • In the late 1970s clandestine women from Africa snuck into Italy for jobs. • Primarily Poles but also many Eastern Europeans flooded the newly united Germany in the 1990s, willing to work for lower wages. All of this was mitigated by the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. • Chechens and peoples from the Caucasus region migrated north to Russia for better jobs and housing following the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. • Tens of thousands of displaced Bosnians, Croats and Serbs migrated west to Italy to escape the Bosnian civil war, 1992–1995. • Thousands of Iraqis found safety and asylum in Scandinavia following the first Gulf War (1990–1991) and the second Gulf War (2003). Massive waves of migration and demographic shifts in Europe resulted in what has been termed the “wage revolution.” Since most immigrants were willing to work longer hours for less wages, the phenomenon called the “browning of Europe” took place, especially following decolonization in the late 1940s and 1950s. This phenomenon explains the dramatic shift in industries that traditionally employed white Europeans (construction, city services and the auto industry) to those populated by non-European immigrants. The wave of immigrants to Europe since 1950 has become a politically explosive issue. At the same time, since 1980 birth rates in many Western European countries continued to decline because of easier access to birth control pills and to abortions. Question 5 — Historical Background Notes (continued) • In 2000, 14 European countries were no longer reproducing their populations. Italy and Spain led the way followed by Germany and Sweden. In other countries population growth has been zero. • Some 1.7 percent of the Italian population is foreign born. • Some 3.4 percent of the UK population is foreign born. • Some 6.3 percent of the French population is foreign born. • Some 8.8 percent of the German population is foreign born. • Some 19 percent of the Swiss population is foreign born. Many Europeans since 1980 have felt themselves overwhelmed by immigrants. Rising intolerance, racism and xenophobia have become apparent in Europe, resulting in the dramatic radicalization of European politics to the right. Ultranationalist and right-wing political parties have increased in membership since the 1960s in Western Europe. The common themes are anti-immigration, anti-foreigner and ultranationalism. All the nationalist parties mentioned below advocate strict immigration laws coupled with “right to work” legislation. • The National Labor Front was founded in the UK in 1967. • The National Democratic Party was founded in Germany in 1964. • The National Front was founded in France in 1972 by Jean-Marie le Pen. • The Alliance for the Future of Austria was founded in 2005 by Jörg Haider. Question 6 Analyze the ways in which the ideas of seventeenth-century thinkers John Locke and Isaac Newton contributed to the ideas of eighteenth-century Enlightenment thinkers. 9–8 Points • The essay provides a sophisticated thesis that is clearly stated, addressing BOTH Locke and Newton and how they influenced Enlightenment thinkers. • The organization is clear and effective. • The essay is well balanced and connects BOTH Locke and Newton to TWO or more Enlightenment thinkers. • All major assertions in the essay are supported by MULTIPLE pieces of relevant evidence. • The essay may contain errors that do not detract from the argument. 7–6 Points • The essay provides a good thesis that is clearly stated, addressing BOTH Locke and Newton and how they influenced Enlightenment thinkers. • The organization is clear and effective. • The essay is well balanced with BOTH Locke and Newton connected to at least ONE thinker of the Enlightenment. • Assertions in the essay are supported by at least TWO pieces of evidence. • The essay may contain an error that detracts from the argument. 5–4 Points • The essay provides an adequate thesis that is clearly stated but uneven, OR the thesis tends to just reword the question. • The organization is unbalanced and not necessarily effective.

While the texts for the most part discuss Newton and Locke separately, in the Enlightenment chapters they actually tend to lay out the connections between Locke, Newton and the Enlightenment. As a result, students should be well prepared to address the tasks presented by this question. Locke’s ideas are presented as stemming from his two major works, The Second Treatise on Civil Government and Essay Concerning Human Understanding. In the Second Treatise Locke declares that government is set up to protect life, liberty and property. He notes that all men have natural rights (because man has the ability to reason) and that people have the right of rebellion if government becomes too tyrannical. Here Locke links economic liberty and private property with political freedom limiting voting rights to property owners. In Locke’s Essay he notes that all ideas are derived from experience. The mind is a blank slate (tabula rasa), and human development is determined by educational and social institutions. He believed that people were reasonable and authority rested in the hands of the majority who owned property. The texts portray Newton as the “greatest and rarest genius that ever rose for the instruction of the human species.” Newton, a devout if unorthodox Christian, noted that his works were directed toward explaining God’s message (religion was necessary). His ability to explain planetary motion and motion on Earth gave science, and through it reason, enormous prestige throughout the West. The texts clearly link both Newton and Locke to the Enlightened philosophes by declaring that they were enchanted by the grand Newtonian design of the world-machine and Locke’s practical and reasonable view of government. The philosophes were convinced that by following the reasoning of these men they could come to discover the natural laws that governed politics, economics, justice, religion and the arts. Several Enlightened writers are commonly connected to Locke and Newton. • David Hume refers to life as only a collection of experiences. He notes that reason cannot tell man anything about things for which the individual has no experiences. • Madame du Chatelet translated Newton’s Principia for the French, thus making the Englishman’s knowledge available for French writers to draw upon for guidance. • Voltaire declared Newton history’s “greatest man.” He mixed Newton’s glorification of science and reason with an appeal for better individuals and institutions. Voltaire defended Newton against the authorities of the times who saw his individualism as a threat to authority. Additionally he used Locke’s virtues to attack Catholic bigotry. • Montesquieu in his writings attacked traditional religious institutions and advocated religious toleration; he denounced slavery through the use of reason (Locke) and in his Spirit of the Laws applied natural law and reason to the relationship of government and law. • Denis Diderot championed Deism, a religious view held by most philosophes that was built on Newton’s natural laws. Question 7 Analyze the development of the various forms of European socialism in the 1800s. 9–8 Points • The essay provides a sophisticated thesis that addresses the question. • The organization is clear. • The essay is well balanced and deals with at least TWO forms of socialism. • All major assertions are supported by at least TWO pieces of relevant evidence. • The essay may contain some minor errors. 7–6 Points • The essay provides a good thesis that addresses the question. • The organization is clear. • The essay is balanced with at least TWO forms of socialism discussed. • All major assertions are supported by at least ONE piece of evidence. • The essay may contain an error. 5–4 Points • The essay provides an adequate thesis OR just restates the question. • The organization is unbalanced and not necessarily effective. The essay feels like a Marx paper or a Louis Blanc essay. • Assertions are supported by ONE piece of relevant evidence. • The narrative is mostly factual, with little analysis. • The essay may contain a few errors of fact or interpretations that detract from the argument. 3–2 Points • There is no thesis or the thesis just restates the question. • The essay is poorly organized and ineffective. • The essay is off task and mostly irrelevant. • The essay shows serious imbalance. • Vague general statements are made with little factual support. • There are major errors. 1–0 Points • There is no thesis. • The organization is poor. • The essay is off task and nonresponsive to the question. • The statements are general, vague and simplistic. • There is little evidence of understanding. • The essay contains major errors. Question 7 — Historical Background Notes The evolution of European socialism in the 1800s is a mainstream theme covered in all the texts. The better essays will demonstrate an understanding of the movement from utopian socialism to that of practical socialism. While Marx had a major influence on European socialism in the 19th century, the prompt is not just about radical Marxism. The essays that receive higher scores will deal with multiple aspects of the European socialist movement. As large-scale industrialization gradually transformed the agricultural economy and society in Western Europe, the 1830s and the 1840s brought heated discussion, lively debates and startling transformations in thought. The rapid increase in wage labor influenced the emergence of new political forces that, proclaiming the equality of all people, sought dramatic social and political change. One of the most powerful results of the growing preoccupation with the condition of workers was the birth of the movement known as socialism. In Europe in the 19th century, socialism focused on worker equality, equitable pay scales and, perhaps most important, humane living and working conditions. Over time, especially after 1871, European socialism became politicized, evolving into mass party movements. Utopian socialists, most of whom were French, provided an original critique of the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution. The name “utopian” reflects their dreams of creating a perfectly harmonious way of life. This philosophy accentuated their determination to put forward demands for political and social reform. • Count Claude-Henri de Saint-Simon (1760–1825) proposed a “religion of humanity” dedicated to alleviating the inhumane conditions of France’s working poor. In 1820 Saint-Simon published a provocative parable, wondering what would happen if all France’s nobles, churchmen, princes and princesses drowned in a terrible shipwreck. Saint-Simon’s conclusion argued that the French proletariat was far more essential for the good of the country and their loss would be disastrous. • Charles Fourier (1772–1837) claimed that there were 810 distinct personality types. Fourier proposed that they be organized into “phalanx” worker communities of 1,620 people, channeling the passions of each person into socially productive ways. • Étienne Cabet (1788–1856) was the most popular and well known of the French utopian socialists. His novel Voyage to Icaria (1840) imagined an imaginary city of wide streets, clean urinals and social harmony, a vision of organized economic and social life so attractive that even the bourgeoisie would be converted peacefully to the principles of cooperation and association. • Robert Owen (1771–1858) built a mill in New Lanark, Scotland. He provided decent housing for his workers and established schools for children. Owen also believed in the emancipation of women. Question 7 — Historical Background Notes (continued) Practical socialists tended to have a less idealist view of the perfect socialist world and worked toward the implementation of socialism in the here and now. While utopian socialists often embraced the nonviolent transformation of European societies, practical socialists tended to be much more militant in their methods. Many practical socialists saw the bourgeoisie as a physical enemy because they possessed capital, unfairly taken from the working class. • Flora Tristan (1801–1844) campaigned against women’s inequality within marriage and before the law. Linking feminism and socialism, she campaigned for female emancipation with passionate speeches. • Louis Blanc (1811–1882) based his socialist model on universal suffrage where workers could increase their influence on governments. Blanc also believed the state should guarantee workers the “right to work.” • Louis Proudhon (1809–1865) looked not to strengthen the state through worker suffrage, but rather to destroy the state. Proudhon argued the very existence of the state was due to capitalism, and therefore the state was instrumental in the exploitation of workers. In 1840 Proudhon published a fiery and provocative pamphlet that answered the question “What is property?” with the resounding reply “Theft!” Preaching the abolition of the state and destruction of all private property, Proudhon had enormous influence on Marx and future Russian socialists. • Karl Marx (1818–1883) read the utopian and practical socialist commentaries and found them “unscientific.” Marx thus was one of the first to advocate “scientific socialism,” basing much of his theory on the dialectical stages of Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831.) Marx was an advocate of the ultraviolent proletariat revolution. Marx would befriend another German socialist, Friedrich Engels. Together they championed the need to destroy the modern capitalist state and to replace it with utopian communism. Out of the philosophy of European socialism grew various socialist political parties, some violent, some not. With the growth of mass politics in the final quarter of the 19th century, European socialism became both radicalized and politicized. • The British Labor Party was founded in 1893 by James Keir Hardie. • The French Workers Party was founded in 1883. • The German Socialist Party (SPD) was founded in 1875 as many German socialists rejected Marx’s cry for violent revolution. Eduard Bernstein (1850–1932) trumpeted the need for German socialists to reject violence and to instead work within the German political system for labor reform. His seminal work Evolutionary Socialism (1898) galvanized a continent, setting the precedent for democratic socialism throughout Europe well into the 20th century. • The Italian Socialist Party was founded in 1892. • The Russian Social Democratic Labor Party was founded in 1898 in Minsk and was the parent organization for both the Russian Bolsheviks and the Russian Mensheviks.
