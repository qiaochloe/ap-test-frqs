The test preparation materials  in this document include images for which descriptions are provided. In a standard test, the images are presented without descriptions. In this document, descriptions are included with the images so that assistive technology users will have an understanding of what is in each image. However, some of the image descriptions may not be valid for testing purposes; and in certain cases we cannot make all of the content accessible due to the construct or design of particular test questions.  Therefore, on an actual test in an alternate format, some questions may be omitted if they include images that cannot be described without affecting the question’s validity. If any questions are omitted, the scoring rules for the test take such omissions into account to make sure that you are neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by the omissions and that your scores are comparable to those of individuals taking another version of the test.A P.

Beginning in the top left part of the map and moving clockwise, the following regions are labeled. England. Low Countries. German States. Swiss Confederacy. Italian States. Spain. And France. Dots are indicated throughout the map. Each dot represents a city that produced at least 50 different books or book editions during the period 1452 to 1500. Few dots are located in England, Spain, France, and the Swiss Confederacy. Denser clusters of dots are located in the Low Countries, the southern and central parts of the German States, and the northern part of the Italian States.Each dot represents a city that produced at least 50 different books or book editions during the period 1452–1500. 2. a) For the period 1452–1500, identify and explain ONE cause that contributed to the geographical distribution of printing centers in Europe shown on the map. b) For the period 1500–1550, identify and explain ONE short-term cultural or political effect of the emergence of printing centers such as the ones shown on the map. c) For the period 1550–1789, identify and explain ONE long-term effect of the spread of printing on European society. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that follows. “The welfare state, in short, was born of a cross-party twentieth-century consensus.... Moreover, and here the memory of war once again played an important role, the twentieth-century ‘socialist’ welfare states were constructed not as an advance guard of egalitarian revolution but to provide a barrier against the return of the past: against economic depression and its polarizing, violent political outcome in the desperate politics of Fascism and Communism alike. The welfare states were thus prophylactic [preventive].... Thanks to a half century of prosperity and safety, we in the West have forgotten the political and social traumas of mass insecurity. And thus we have forgotten why we have inherited those welfare states and what brought them about.” Tony Judt, British historian, Reappraisals: Reﬂections on the Forgotten Twentieth Century, 2008 3.a) Provide ONE piece of evidence that would support Judt’s argument regarding the creation of welfare states. b) Provide ONE piece of evidence that would support Judt’s characterization of political and economic
 conditions in the period 1960 to 2000.
 c) Briefly analyze ONE way in which Judt’s argument is a response to the political and intellectual trends in late-twentieth-century Europe. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that follows. “For if Tycho Brahe,* considering the immensity of those globes [the planets], believed that they did not exist pointlessly in the world, but were packed with inhabitants, how much more convincing will it be for us, perceiving the variety of the works and intentions of God on this globe of Earth, to adopt a similar conjecture about the others as well? For He has created species to inhabit the waters, though there is no place under them for air, which living things draw in; He has sent into the immensity of the air birds propped up by feathers; He has given to the snowy tracts of the north white bears and white foxes....HasHe then used up all His skill on the globe of the Earth? For whose benefit do four moons gird Jupiter,** as this single Moon of ours does our home? In fact we shall also reason in the same way about the globe of the Sun—is that globe empty but the others full, if everything else corresponds more closely? If just as the Earth breathes out clouds, the Sun breathes out black soot [sun spots]?***” Johannes Kepler, German mathematician, astronomer, and astrologist, Harmony of the World, treatise, 1619. * Danish astronomer (1546–1601) who is considered the pioneer of scientific astronomical observation. ** The four largest moons of Jupiter were discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei. *** Sun spots were first observed telescopically in 1610–1611 by several European astronomers. 4.a) Analyze ONE way in which the passage reflects traditional views of the cosmos. b) Analyze ONE way in which the passage challenges traditional views of the cosmos. c) Choose ONE example of a scientific discovery made during the Scientific Revolution (other than the discoveries explicitly mentioned in the passage) and explain how it challenged traditional views of nature. END OF SECTION I

Evaluate whether or not the Glorious Revolution of 1688 can be considered part of the Enlightenment. Document 1 Source: John Evelyn, writer and founding member of the Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge, diary entry, 1688 7th October—Dr. Tenison [an Anglican minister] preached at St. Martin’s church, showing the Scriptures to be our only rule of faith, and its perfection above all traditions. After which, near 1,000 devout persons partook of the Communion. The sermon was chiefly a response to a sermon by a Jesuit, who the Sunday before had disparaged the Scripture and railed at our translation. Some who were present [on that Sunday] pulled the Jesuit out of the pulpit, and treated him very coarsely. Hourly expectation of William, the Prince of Orange’s invasion heightened to that degree, that his Majesty [James II] thought fit to dispense with all laws and in the meantime, he called over 5,000 Irish and 4,000 Scots soldiers, and continued to remove Protestants and put in Papists at Portsmouth harbor and other places of trust, and retained the Jesuits about him, increasing the universal discontent. It brought people to so desperate a pass, that they seemed passionately to long for and desire the landing of the Prince of Orange, whom they looked on to be their deliverer from Popish tyranny, praying incessantly for an east wind, which was said to be the only hindrance of his expedition [from the Netherlands] with a numerous army ready to make a descent. Document 2 Source: King William III, declaration, October 10, 1688 The Declaration of His Highness William, by the Grace of God, Prince of Orange, etc., of the reasons inducing him to appear in arms in the Kingdom of England, and for preserving the Protestant religion, and for restoring the laws and liberties of England, Scotland, and Ireland: We for our part will concur in everything that may procure the peace and happiness of that nation, which a free and lawful Parliament shall determine, since we have nothing before our eyes in this our undertaking but the preservation of the Protestant religion, the covering of all men from persecution for their conscience, and the securing to the whole nation the free enjoyment of all their laws, rights, and liberties, under a just and legal government. Document 3 Source: Excerpts from the English Bill of Rights, passed by Parliament and ratified by William III, 1689
 Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons, being now assembled in a full and free representative of this
 nation, do in the first place (as their ancestors in like case have usually done) for the vindicating and asserting
 their ancient rights and liberties declare:
 That the pretended power of suspending the laws or the execution of laws by royal authority without consent
 of Parliament is illegal;
 That levying money for or to the use of the Crown by pretence of prerogative, without grant of Parliament,
 for longer time, or in other manner than the same is or shall be granted, is illegal;
 That the raising or keeping of a standing army within the kingdom in time of peace, unless it be with consent
 of Parliament, is against law;
 That the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions and as
 allowed by law;
 That the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or
 questioned in any court or place out of Parliament;
 That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments
 inflicted;
 And that for redress of all grievances, and for the amending, strengthening and preserving of the laws,
 Parliaments ought to be held frequently.
 Document 4 Source: Gilbert Burnet, Anglican bishop and close friend of William III, sermon preached at the coronation ceremony of William III, April 1689 When the encouraging and promoting of a vigorous piety, and sublime virtue, and the explaining and propagating of true religion is the chief design of their rule; when impiety and vice are punished, and error is repressed; when the decency of the worship of God is kept up, without adulterating it with superstitions; when order is carried on in the Church of God, without tyranny; and above all when princes are in their own deportment [conduct], examples of the fear of God...and when it is visible that they honour those who fear the Lord, and that vile men are despised by them, then do they truly rule in fear of God. Document 5 Source: John Locke, English writer, Two Treatises of Government, 1689 The reason why men enter into society, is the preservation of their property; and the end why they choose and authorize a legislative power, is, that there may be laws made, and rules set, as guards and fences to the properties of all the members of the society, to limit the power, and moderate the dominion, of every part and member of the society: for since it can never be supposed to be the will of the society, that the legislative should have a power to destroy that which every one designs to secure, by entering into society, and for which the people submitted themselves to legislators of their own making; whenever the legislators endeavour to take away, and destroy the property of the people, or to reduce them to slavery under arbitrary power, they put themselves into a state of war with the people, who are thereupon absolved from any farther obedience, and are left to the common refuge, which God hath provided for all men, against force and violence....the supreme executor, who having a double trust put in him, both to have a part in the legislative, and the supreme execution of the law, acts against both, when he goes about to set up his own arbitrary will as the law of the society. Document 6 Source: Voltaire, French writer, Letters on the English, 1726–1729 The English are the only people upon earth who have been able to prescribe limits to the power of kings by resisting them; and who, by a series of struggles, have at last established that wise Government where the Prince is all powerful to do good, and, at the same time, is restrained from committing evil; where the nobles are great without insolence, though there are no vassals; and where the people share in the Government without confusion.... The English have doubtless purchased their liberties at a very high price, and waded through seas of blood to drown the idol of arbitrary power. Other nations have been involved in as great calamities, and have shed as much blood; but then the blood these other nations spilt in defense of their liberties only enslaved them the more. Document 7 Source: “William and Mary,” woodcut from a mid-eighteenth-century English children’s book, showing William III and his wife and coruler Queen Mary II The Granger Collection, New York The scroll in William’s hand is labeled “Bill of Rights.” The rhyming verse below the image reads: “William the hero, with Maria mild, /(He James’s nephew, she his eldest child)/Fix’d freedom and the church, reform’d the coin;/Oppos’d the French and settled Brunswick’s line*.” * a reference to the principle that only a Protestant would be allowed to become ruler of Great Britain, offıcially adopted in 1701 END OF DOCUMENTS FOR QUESTION 1 Question 2 or Question 3
